0,3.0 ,"  After reading a lot of geeky reviews on YouTube and portals, I bought Oneplus7t. Pls, note I have been using OnePlus from last many years now so my expectations were clear. My experience with the device says that most of the reviews or unboxing things are influenced. Pls, note I have bought it with my own money unlike leading reviewers or unboxing video geeks who get it for free. So pls don't go by them blindly. Go for users reviews who bought them with their own money. So I am writing my 5 days experience with the phone.I am not a gamer or a geek. A regular user who wants to do all the office work on the phone, social media, blogging and vlogging, etc.The last OnePlus phone I was using was Oneplus 5 and was quite happy with it until it screen got broken and replacement cost was higher than the selling price of the device itself.The day it arrived from Amazon I opened it with a lot of excitement which continued till I have held it in my hands.Here are the issues:1. Weight: It weighed too much I felt like holding a brick. And it is thick. When I hold it in one hand for a few minutes I get a deep red pit in my hand (due to blood circulation).2. Camera: Then I had to go for a conference there I tried clicking pictures. Picture quality did not come out well. Still, I thought it may be light or background because of my previous experiences I could not believe it to be not good. So I continued clicking pictures which really missed detailing. As you zoom in it will make it blurred. I have clicked a magazine cover picture with my Oneplus 5 which had only 16 MP camera but pic quality was natural and good. It clicks blur pics may it has to do with image Stabilization.3. Battery:  Battery is avg. All those time I teased my iPhone or Samsung Series colleagues and friends for their battery life. Welcome to the league. This offers an avg battery life. I never carried a charger with me in previous models if I Start with 90% even after two years. But here I have to carry it even for the average usage. I m wondering what would be this phone battery life in a year or more.4. 90 Hz refresh rate is a gimmick to sell this device. It will give you fluid experience but the soon it consumes battery you will always prefer to keep it to 60hz which is an option given in the display settings. If you always stick to a desk or have a power source around you can keep it to 90hz. Not for people who are on the move most of the time. Don't fall for it.5. Sound: It's average. Phone calls are not crisp and clear. At times the caller's voice gets hazy and husky. Voice is even audible to person the person sitting next to me. Even on lower volumes. Speakers volume is loud but the sound quality is not good.6. No premium-feeling anymore. With multiple variants, it has joined the league of Samsung, Mi, Oppo, Vivo. Now they are launching 7t pro on Oct 10 again it is a disappointment for those who bought 7t on day 1. Maybe their R&D or trials have some problem here that in every two months they are launching a new device with an update to the previous faults. Like OnePlus 7 has voice receiver on one side which is right. So if you take calls or hear the phone from left you won't get a clear voice or volume. So they added receivers on both the side in this device.I am still not getting why I have spent Rs 40,000 on it. No camera quality, no battery life, no sound quality on calls, getting wounds on holding it for long.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought it on the day of the launch but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.

3,5.0 ,"  I received One Plus 7T 2 days back. I will describe you my experience in these 2 days.Firstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNO Headset jack.One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Overall: 4.7/5  One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.

"
4,5.0 ,"  8 Gb Ram128 Gb storage.This is super amazing phone.It is super fast Like bullet Train.Obviously it will never hang.Camera quality is better than OnePlus 7  Because it has triple camera 😍 .Design of phone is also amazing.Turbo charging with 3800 mAH battery is too good.

"
5,1.0 ,"  My first one+7t & its make me so sad. I received the ph with manufacturing defect in display. Gum came out from the edges of display. How can a consumer aspects from a reputed brand after he paying 40000/- 🤔😭😟🥺😓

"
6,4.0 ,"  This phone has great performance, good camera and ambiance. Charging is fast as per the Oneplus standards set in earlier phones. What is concerning me is the heating issue which crops up off and on. The Battery drains quickly so we have to keep it at 60Hz to longer life. Is there anyone else feeling the heating issues?

"
7,1.0 ,"  THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST PHONE I HAVE EVER PURCHASED. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS PHONE AND PUT YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON STAKE. THERE ARE SO MANY CONS IN THIS PHONE. EARLIER I HAVE USED ONE PLUS 5T PHONE SO I KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT FROM THIS PHONE BUT THIS TIME I AM SO MUCH DISAPPOINTED.HERE ARE MY CONCERNS1. SCREEN RESOLUTION AND QUALITY OF THE SCREEN IS SO POOR. THERE IS GRAINS AND COLOR BANDING ISSUE IN SCREEN. IMAGES LOOKS GRAINY AND UNSHARP IN COMPARISION TO ONE PLUS 5T OR 6T. PHONE RATIO IS 20:9 SO INSTAGRAM IMAGES WILL BE IN SHOWN IN PORTRAIT MODE INSTEAD OF LANDSCAPE MODE. IMAGES ON THE SCREEN IS SO BLURRRY2. DESIGN OF THE PHONE IS MESS. SO MUCH CAMERA BULK. EVEN THE PROVIDED CASE CANNOT PROTECT IT FROM SCRATCHES. PHONE IS VERY FAT AND HAEVY. LENGTH IS ALSO TOO MUCH BECAUSE OF THE RATIO. ALSO THERE IS NO PREMIUM FEELING AFTER HOLDING THIS PHONE AS WAS WITH THE ONE PLUS 5T.3. 3.5MM JACK IS BIG OMMISSION SINCE ONE PLUS 6 PHONE. THERE IS NO BENEFIT OF REMOVING IT. THERE IS NO BIGGER BATTERY. ALSO YOU HAVE TO BUY A SEPERATE ADAPTER OR NEW BLUTOOTH EARPHONES AND BLUTOOTH EARPHONES QUALITY CAN NEVER BE AS GOOD AS WIRED EARPHONES.4. CAMERA QUALITY IS AVERAGE. NO INCREASE IN PICTURE QUALITY. 3 CAMERAS ARE ONLY FOR NAME SAKE.I WAS VERY HAPPY ONE PLUS CUSTOMER, BUT NOW I WON'T RECOMMEND THIS PHONE TO ANYONE. PLEASE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

"
8,5.0 ,"  I am among the first to buy this phone with prime membership. Posting this review after a week of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good. There is no lagging issue till now. The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first. Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit. Speakers are loud and produce decent sound. Haven't checked the selfie camera and the video recording till now.

10,5.0 ,"  A One plus user.Oneplus One -> Oneplus 3T -> Oneplus 7T.I don't like other android phones due it's UI, love stock android.Camara is awesomeFacing problem with notifications, don't know what at top.I was expecting great battery but its average.As i moved from 3T to 7T, I had to buy wireless headphones and was worried about this. But Bluetooth connection is also good/stable.

"
11,1.0 ,"  The smart Lock feature is not working on the phone. It doesn't require PIN/ fingerprint sensor sometimes. It gets unlocked by side power button which creates a big security issue. The battery back up is just pathetic. Not so great camera make is totally underserving for the kind of price OnePlus is selling this device. If option available, I would have asked for refund.

"
12,5.0 ,"  After 1st update battery capacity is good

"
13,1.0 ,"   I am uploading a video and image watch it before but it,Don't waste your money on this phone @this price range.Many customers faces same as I am facing the issue of screen flickering while watching videos specially YouTube.. if u do not noticed, now notice it on the upper side where the notch is setup. Play YouTube u can see when u do for full screen and again normal.I am purchased it but thanks to Amazon they replaced it but again same issue 'screen flickering' and again thanks to Amazon they approve my return and now I get my refund..But seriously this device is not too good at this price. So pls don't waste your money.And OnePlus, with u never expect like this.

"
14,3.0 ,"  It has many features to tell but will tell only two problems of it..1. Battery Draining like hell.2. Heating issues.Don't know why but these two severe problems I'm facing..I play games..Never ever expected such experience with this Premium Phone..

16,5.0 ,"  This beast puts One Plus back in the game!7T should have been the only product launched by OnePlus instead of 7 & 7pro!What a phone it is!Processing speed 5/5Camera 4.2/5Look n Feel 4.8/5Performance 5/5Lags 0/5Charging 5/5Highlights:90GHz screen refresh rate is something that's puts OnePlus 7T in the league of the iPhones and the S10.Cons:Nightmode could have been better!Not upto the mark of Pixel and even iPhone 11Battery could have been 4000mah, but still 30T warp is a mind-blowing deal.Memory slot could have been arranged.Wow factor:30T 😘Telephoto lens 😘Configs 8GB-128 combo is sufficientNow, coming to comparison with iPhone XR and iPhone 11, personally I would prefer OnePlus because of flexibility, Android ecosystem provides to the users.Verdict:A perfect benchmark from most of the parameters.Performance wise is a SHOWSTOPPER!!Should you upgrade from 7 to 7T -NO, save your money.From iPhone 8 or Below to 7T -Yes

"
17,1.0 ,"  Very worst on speed. hanging and not responding at all. Got mobile day before yesterday on 2nd Oct and installed only basic apps like whatsapp, fb, banking apps and no movies or any other images or music loaded but still it is hanging.Now the clock is not working and the alarm is not ringing which is a very basic feature

"
18,5.0 ,"  Amazing phone.. and charging is awesome.. 0 to 100 in just 51 min

"
19,5.0 ,"  Firstly, I didn't receive my headset. It's mentioned on Amazon website that the customers will get a free headset in the box.This is like misleading the customers by giving false information.Secondly, I want to say. I like everything about this phone. This is my first Oneplus phone and I love Oxygen OS.Having said that, I'm facing some minor heating issues with my phone. It's on and off but it still bothers me. Didn't expect it would happen with Oneplus. Hope this can be fixed. Had heard a lot about OnePlus so, when I decided to purchase a new phone I picked OnePlus 7T over ROG 2.Battery is decent. Does not drain out quickly. Using dark mode helps a lot in saving battery even after heavy usage.I don't like the camera of this phone. When you use beauty mode it entirely changes your face and you look really weird. Samsung, Oppo, Vivo are far better when it comes to camera. Wide angle photos also come out odd. When you click objects using wide angle they come out well. But, when you click photos of people the person in the front comes out really bad. Especially with the selfie camera. This phone has the worse selfie camera.I was earlier using Samsung S7 Edge which was much smaller compared to OnePlus 7T. This phone is big. So, it will take some time for me to get adjusted to this phone.

"
20,5.0 ,"  It is good phone. Best at it's price point. Great phone better than Asus Rog phone 2 in overall performance. Buy it without any second thought. Better display 90hz fluid amoled 2400*1080. If you want a allrounder go for it.

"
21,1.0 ,"  I was using Samsung phone and with all the talk going around thought of giving one plus a try.  Received oneplus7t and set up the phone.  Not worth of spending. They don't have 3.5 mm audio jack and they don't provide type c connector also. Samsung phone comes with good quality headphones.  When apple released phone without audio Jack, they provided connector.It's big disappointment for me as I make lot of calls using earphones.One plus need to think about it..

"
22,5.0 ,"  Beast compared to any product and wonderful product provided by one plus.Thanks for the one plus tean.

"
25,5.0 ,"  I had been using Mi for the past 4 years. Loved the software experience there but I knew something was lacking on the hardware end.I decided to switch over to some real flagship grade phone around the 40K mark like S10e or Pixel 3a and I had almost bought either one, just  when the pics of the OnePlus 7T were teased online by OnePlus.The design of the OP7T had my attention immediately ! And I decided to wait for it.Not much review and comparison videos for the 7T were available before the first sale , but blown away by the sheer looks of 7T,  I instantly bought the OnePlus 7T as soon as it went on sale on 28th and trust me I will never regret my decision to choose OnePlus.I will now classify this review category wise:-DESIGN: The design looks fabulous. Elegant is the right word for the Frosted Silver colour. The matte frosted glass back and the circular camera looks dope! Not at all fingerprint magnet unlike previous 1+ Mirror finishes.IN-HAND: The phone is taller than OnePlus 6T (for comparison) but is a tad thinner and feels lighter. The overall in-hand feel is great due to the curvedback glass and narrower width and even when you hold it without a case, it doesn't slip. It feels premium for sure.CAMERA: The triple camera setup is a serious upgrade over the previous OnePlus as well as Mi phones. The photo quality is great. Sharp and detailed images are produced by these camera.The nightscape images are good too. The macro mode is something I've never seen on any phone before . The macros are so up close and detailed. Check my Nightscape and Macro mode samples.The main camera has OIS and EIS and the videos are really stable. That's what I was talking about the OIS as a hardware feature was lacking on my previous mid range phones.And I am so glad it has a small notch for the front camera instead of pop up camera, as I'm not a fan of pop up cams and I just doubt their longevity in real world conditions.BATTERY: First of all the WARP charge is some serious tech. I mean from 10% to 100% it just charged in less than an hour. Also, OnePlus claims that you can plug in your phone and can use it as well as play games while the phone is charging and there won't be any heating issues.As for the battery back up, on the first day after setup the battery drained really quickly, even on standby. But in the next couple of days the Android 10 AI kicked in and it learnt my usage pattern and started giving me notifications as to which app is draining battery and asked me to optimise it. Also it showed a notification that it had restricted background activities of certain apps overnight when I was not using the phone.I also tweaked the background activities and battery optimisation of  certain apps manually and trust me now my phone is giving me a day and a half's backup.Moreover the full dark mode in the Developer options looks dope as well as save a lot of battery as it's an AMOLED screen.SOT: My Screen On Time immediately before this review was around 7 hours with 30% battery still left and time since last charge was 18 hours. No gaming in these 7 hours, but I watched Netflix, YouTube , used WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram browsed the web, made calls and my 4G data was active the entire time.[UPDATE: After receiving a small 112MB update for bug fixes and camera improvement, my SOT was a little over 9 hours 30 minutes ,over a Day and a half's usage, which is insane considering the 90Hz display. Well SOT and battery backup total depends on usage pattern. Mine includes calling, texting, browsing , social media over 4G mobile data....but no gaming so far]SCREEN: 7T has a large and dynamic screen with really good contrast and rich colours. You can calibrate the display as per your taste. The much hyped 90Hz display is true. You can really feel the difference between a 60 HZ and a 90HZ. 90Hz is so much smoother.SOFTWARE: 7T came with Android 10 out of the box. What more can you ask for! Also the Oxygen OS is great. Stock Android with a few improvisations and minimum bloatware. It's an amazing experience overall.PERFORMANCE: Well here the numbers say it all. Check the Antutu scores. It just tops the list. Blazing fast speed and performance. Instantly opens and switches apps without any lag. Didn't face any hang or freeze issues so far. No device heating issues so far.HAPTIC FEEDBACK: Guys you really need to feel it to believe it. The haptic feedback you feel while typing or playing a notification sound or music is just next level.CUSTOMER SUPPORT: I didn't encounter any issues to be calling customer care ,but I called them to inquire about how to avail  the ""Free 1-Year Extended Warranty"" . Yes you read it right. OnePlus just offered a complimentary extended warranty and you should just avail it. Well as for the customer care I was very well guided as to how to avail it . Also they were really polite and courteous and also followed up.PROTECTION PLANS: I would seriously suggest you to just consider checking out the protection plans on OnePlus website. They are pretty economical and would just provide you an assurance that you device is covered from accidental drops or water damage. I bought one and it now gives me a peace of mind that the premium price I paid for this device, is insured.All in all I would say it's a True Flagship device in the 30's price bracket.I just don't know what else a flagship phone can pack in more , perhaps wireless charging and IP68 rating!But those 2 features aren't a deal breaker as the WARP charge is like twice or thrice as fast as wireless charging, which leaves wireless charging just a mere showoff feature as you really can't use the phone while wirelessly charging it. I don't find any practicality in wireless charging.As for the IP rating I would say it's ""Unofficially"" fairly water resistant. Checkout various water drop tests on You Tube. But just don't try them :PWell, just go for this phone ( if your budget allows) for a true FLAGSHIP EXPERIENCE, You won't regret buying it.

"
27,5.0 ,"  I'm an iPhone user for last few years!! So I had a feeling any Android device cannot beat the camera, display and user interface experience of iphone. But here it is, OnePlus 7T with 90hz display is just a magic in hand. And also the camera is just superb.Initially I wanted to go for iPhone 11, buy instead decided to go for this and I feel I made a right decision. So close to eyes and go for this, you'll love it

"
32,5.0 ,"  Was sceptical when watched reviews that it gives OnePlus 7pro a run for it's money. But having using since last 4days. I am assured that it does give OnePlus 7pro, Samsung S10 and even Iphone 11 a run for the money.Interface- I used MIUI, EMIUI, amigo os, but none of those were never smooth as Oxygen OS. It's super fluid and killing fast (credit also goes to SD855+ and 8gb ram).Camera- One of the best under 50k that's the only thing I can say.Built Quality- On par with other premium smartphonesDisplay- Have used LCD panel display phones for entire life. So yes, really enjoying watching videos. (And to make the things more sweeter Stereo Speakers on the phone)Verdict- If you can spend 3-4k more than OnePlus 7. Then do it. It will be worth it.

"
37,5.0 ,"  Update 1: just got the new update to oxygen OS 10.0.3 and the issues with the gaming mode are gone....Been using this for 2 days now and let me say this first this is a great device and I am really really glad I bought this and not Samsung Note 10. Now here is my review broken down in Pros and Cons list.Pros:Comes with pre-applied screen guard and a transparent silicon case in the box.As always Cable quality is great and Charger is well built.Display quality is great and as in the spec sheet it is a HDR10+ certified display which provides gorgeous colors and great viewing experience.In-Hand feel is also great, the device has a weight to it that doesn't make it too heavy or to light to use.The back glass is slippery but not as slippery as previous OnePlus devices.I have big hands so I can easily reach the far corners for gesture navigation.Performance is just top notch. I haven't used any device till now that can surpass the fluidity of this device. Everything feels so natural and seamless.The 90Hz display is just great and adds to the faster experience of the device.Speakers are not as good as the ASUS ROG Phone 2 or the iPhone XS PRO MAX but they are great for the price range and may be equal to Samsung Note series.Call quality is great on JIO and Vodafone networks, Mic also performs a great job in cancelling the ambient noise so the other party can hear your voice clearly in both loudspeaker and normal modes.Charging speeds are great too. Got the device fully charged from 15% tot 100% in just and hour and that is great.The new Android 10  with Oxygen OS is great and fluid as I said earlier but there are still some bugs to be fixed by the OnePlus team.The front camera is great for casual selfies in ample light situations but in low light the software is not yet optimized yet.The same goes for the triple camera setup at the back. It is a good camera but can be made better using the software. In a lot of light the pictures comes great but sometimes the colors are faded out. in Low light there is a bit much noise for my liking and same goes for the Macro shots.Battery life is great and I am constantly getting around 5hr of screen on time with my average to above average usage of the device.Cons:Hardware wise there are no cons in the device but software wise there are a bit of bugs and much needed improvement.There is a bug whenever I open a Game or any graphics intensive app the screen first goes to black and then O have to lock the device and unlock it again using the face unlock to get to the game screen.The Camera software is not optimized yet.Battery life can be an issue for some users.The Navigation gestures are the worst to ever grace the Android Screen. They are slow, Clumsy and needs a lot of getting use-to by someone who is coming from the older OnePlus gestures. Not to mention the issues I feel while using the Back gesture with the tall side ridges in the provided case. I have to literally put pressure on the thumb to dig into the edge of the display and the ridge of the case to get it working every-time and now I have switched back to older 3 button navigation.

"
38,1.0 ,"  Did not get three cases with 7t mobile.

"
39,1.0 ,"  This phone has overheating issue even for normal browsing. A reputed brand with an issues like this is not acceptable. I am not happy with my phone after investing so much. Amazon has to be taken care there trusted buyers by replacing the defected phone.

Instead buy iphone or vivo...Wasted my money.Also amazon is responsible for not taking back phone on the very same day.

"
42,5.0 ,"  Pros:Design looks sleek and easy to handle though it's a big screen. Well balanced in the hand. My 3T feels a little heavy though there is not much of a weight difference.Good Speed and performance.Very good display.Excellent cameras. Definitely a big change from previous models.Cons:Still in the process of experiencing the product. Will update based on my findings.

"
43,1.0 ,"  Phone is good but cover of the is given by OnePlus is damage. Let me know the procedure to replace .

"
44,5.0 ,"  Hands down. It's a beast. Flagship killer anyday.Lucky enough to buy one of these at mid budget price.Battery performance is not that great but for the 90hz display I think it does just fine. And anyway your getting the 30w fast charger.Customisations in oxygen OS are cool and hardware feels premiumStock android experience which I always love.Scary part is the glass back. Feels slippery and online videos show its tendency to break on impact. For now, iam using the case which comes in the box and its decent.I see forums complaining about the ugly camera but in real it doesn't look that ugly at all. Camera does the job perfectly in all modes. You don't need the iPhone 11 pro unless your a professional photographer and care about detailing.Overall I would give this phone a 9/10 and a major go.Buying this will not put a hole in your pocket and gives you the value of each penny spent. OnePlus phones can be easily used for 3-4 years and maybe even more since the company sends in updates regularly.Hope this review is useful.

46,1.0 ,"   Battery drains very fast.Camera result is so poor. Blurred photos are coming.Mainly phone hangs a lot with Normal operation. Refer attached video.Sometimes thumb lock is not working.When phone hangs, it gets clear by switch on/off the phone.One day all of sudden phone screen turns into black color. By pressing all places on screen, all side button press & switch on /off function was not helping to turn on the phone. So, i put my charger to see if anything is happens to turn on the phone but not worked. Finally I pressed + key & lock key together & it turned on with fresh device.I need replacement with freah & healthy device or return back all my money. Amazon team plz guide how to make complain to One plus team.Regards,Yatin

"
47,1.0 ,"  Product is worse, with respect to camera, it cannot reproduce the skin tone or texture even under broad day light. It struggles to sharpness and structure of image.My earlier review was removed for being honest, let's see, the Amazon is really considering to hide the fact by not accepting the real customer problem and removing it

"
48,5.0 ,"  The said phone is a piece of beauty. Looks amazingly beautiful in hand and the in-hand feeling is just awesome.From the very beginning the buying process on Amazon is simply smooth thereafter the product was delivered before the expected delivery time.The phone looks really sophisticated and the 90 Hz Display is smooth like never before. The Glacier Blue colour is the one which is being promoted predominantly by OnePlus but trust me the Frosted Silver colour is stunning.These are just the initial impressions and a more detailed review will follow after a few days of intense usage.

"
49,1.0 ,"  this is the worst device by oneplus i have ever seen.there is a red / green tint issue at lower brightness levels. i had to replace the first one because of the issue and the replacement device also had an issue so i had to return it. other then this display issue the device is fantastically built with great camera quality and OS.but the main thing in a smartphone which we will be seeing is the display and having such an issue with display is not acceptable. although oneplus is denying the occurence of such an issue. please beware before buying this. check this thing the moment your device arrives. get brightness below 40% and see if there is tint on dark grey / black backgrounds. if there is promptly return it. because oneplus stores might not accept any claims afterwards.

"
50,3.0 ,"  Battery life sucks!It drains completely in less than 5 hours after countinous usage.Iphone 11 gives about 10 hours of SOT even after having a small battery.Think before you purchase.I want OnePlus and Amazon to fix this as soon as they can otherwise this phone would get negative remarks just for its battery.

52,1.0 ,"   This is my second device after replacement of the firstly bought OnePlus 7T , first time i got a defective product and the issue was battery draining. Although the OnePlus 7T has battery draining issue but the one I had was so rapid in battery draining. So within the return period i requested for a refund but Amazon denied and only issued for a  replacement. I tried my best calling customer support but they were so rude and never accepted my refund request. So i got my replacement. When coming to this replaced device , this is the one having lot of problems than the first one especially the main feature like camera. Front cam is not working at all and OnePlus claims that they have better software but the phone is very lag at some point and some apps might also get crashed while in use. I fed up with this device and for my bad luck i opened the box after return date because i was busy with exams. So they denied my replacement request by saying the return window has closed and asked me to contact OnePlus. I contacted OnePlus they also repeated the same they can't help me by replacing only they could do is to repair my newly bought phone. Is it fair enough from Amazon or OnePlus side to repair a newly bought phone and especially the one having inbuilt hardware issue? So without any option i went to Kochi service centre for repairing , they checked my phone and they told that it's just a software issue and told me to come after some hours. So i came after some hours and they did something with my phone and gave it back , then i checked infront of them . Very unfortunate from their side so i burst in to anger because when i opened the front cam still it's not functioning. So without even checking the condition of the phone they gave it back. So probably what would we do? This is my experience from Amazon and OnePlus side , so you decide before buying this phone. Worst phone and worst service from Amazon and OnePlus side. I'm just a student and with all my savings i bought this dream phone but it became my nightmare.Nothing more to be added about this phone in all departments it sucks.Please don't buy it from Amazon and if you have any other option go for another brand.

Internet connectivity shows very slow. When i checked with my old phone it was downloading the app with in few second, whereas this phone show downloading more than 1hr.  I am not happy the way mobile is functioning. I think there is an software issue into this phone.

59,3.0 ,"  Ok so I am using this device from 3 days. Here is my review. I bought this phone after using iPhone 7 plus and Vivo NEX. Everyone here is writing about pros. But I will write about cons.1. UI - there are too many issues with software. For example it has gesture navigation option. But trust me. Its use less. You will be back to old school navigation key after few hours. Every one use mobile case these days. And it is very hard to use those gestures with case on. Also it conflicts with many apps. You will not be able to open menu of any app due to these gestures. Vivo nex has this feature but they implemented it very well.2. Battery - It has only 3800mAh battery. You may have watched many videos it is enough for 5-6 hours. Trust me it's not. I am getting only 4- hours SOT with very normal uses. Update - I lost 2% battery while writing this review.3. Charging - Oneplus says it support 30W charger. So let me come to reality. I Compared this phone with my old vivo nex. And I found 7t charges at maximum 3450mA (checked with Ampare app). And Vivo nex with has 23.5W charger charges at 4100mA. Don't know why any YouTube didn't mentioned it.4. Camera - The thing I liked about camera is just macro mode. Every thing else is still below average in this price range. Front camera and portrait mode is even worse than my 3 year old iPhone 7 plus.Fingerprint, facescanner and performance is perfect.

"
60,4.0 ,"  Here are my initial impressions after using the phone for 3 days.Battery life is worse than my one plus 5, I usually watch YouTube for 1hr, 4g and WiFi are always on. And listen to music on Bluetooth for 2hrs.After end of day I usually have 20% juice remaining.Multiple apps have issues with the supplied OS. Youbroadband app refuses to open, Spotify has issues when listening to music on Bluetooth and camera app stutters at time.The new navigation system takes some getting used to, and the case, screen guard makes it very difficult to perform the back gesture.Now the positives.90hz refresh rate is noticeable.Speakers are loud and clear.Screen is beautiful.I watched couple of hdr videos and 1000nits screen makes the video pop out even more.Phone is blazing fast.And I love the clutter free oxygen OS.I haven't tested camera properly, will update this review once I do.

62,1.0 ,"  This phone is 2 months old, i am still paying it's EMI and it just slipped and fell from sofa to floor with not much force. Phone display went green and it stopped functioning. Touch was also not working. Even though I had warranty for 1 year and there no physical damage on phone, not even a single scratch. one plus told that it's physical damage and I have to pay 12000 to recover my phone their service is so bad that they don't listen to customer they will put all the blame on you, even if the phone is defective. It's Normal for phone to slip and fall. I was using Moto g5s+ which was most durable phone. Also I had a colleague who had same issue with Samsung and they did everything with warranty so there is nothing as bad as one plus. This one plus is just making money it won't let you settle with what u have paid. If u buy one plus 7t u will never settle with one payment. Be careful one plus fans. I was one till this happened to me.

68,5.0 ,"  Ladies and GentlemanPutting up this review after 1 week of rigorous use of the OnePlus 7T .Firstly, if you have the money and you want to invest in a decent flagship phone and tired of the vivos and MIs of the world...then your search ends here!Presenting 1+7t, the flagship premium phone presented to us by 1+Firstly to start off you are going to love the display...the 90Hz refresh is one beauty of a feature. Powered with sAMOLED display, this phone doesn't leave any stones unturned.It has a nice powereful 8gb RAM that does justice to the phone. In short its an iOS version of AndroidWrap30t powerful charging powers your phone to 70% in less than 30 mins and 100% in less than  an hour. The charger is a bit bulky. But you are not going to carrry it all time with ur phone ;). the battery runs for about a day with mediun to high usage.Storage- if youare a heavy user with a lot of gaming and media content, go for the 256gb version. Else 128gb should do the job well.Enhanced features like Digital wellbeing, Zen mode helps u to measure ur screen time and achieve a good mobile-life balanceOxygenOS is smooth and this vomes with a perloaded  Oxygen10 OS out of the box.Dolby Atmos surround sound works like a masterpiece. You wont need the full volume most of the times..Pls note- this phone does not have a 3.5mm audio jack. You got to buy a good decent type C to Aux converter OR simply just buy a good Bluetooth headset.The camera is lovely. Pictures are just perfect with the right color balance. Doesn't whitewash ur pix like the mid range phones. It can put up a good show against the latest iPhone variants.The finger print sensor is decent and does its job.The packaging is premium. It is a big box, All RED, with an invite letter, charger, back cover, some stickers.The phone comes with a preloaded glass protector and a premium case with all the cuts at the right places .Betwen 1+7 and 7t, if you are running low on budget and willing to compromise on the Triple camera setup, 30t charging, 90Hz display...Go for the base 1+7 variant.Between 1+7t and pro, go for 7t guys...as this is packed with a much advanced hardware.Guys also look for the 1+7t series launch on Oct 19 before evaluating.Hope you all enjoyed the review.

The possibile reason for all this could be keeping phone on 90 hz setting. You may bring it down to 60 hz in settings and phone would work fine ( if u r not a fan of immersive display n videos)

If it continues the same, will plan to return. Display is amazing. Camera, if I zoom it picture clarity is bad, literally I can count the pixels.

"
75,3.0 ,"  I have always been a good fan of OnePlus phones. OnePlus 5 being my 1st purchase and after 2 years I thought of shifting to 7T , no nothing  happened to 5 its still running good.Ok, everyone talks about speed, RAM, Performance... that's what OnePlus is about right? But how often have you heard good battery, best camera being associated with OnePlus phones and this was no exception.- The most hyped feature 90Hz is though a very good feature but believe me you wont miss. Some features are like nice to have and not must to have. So 90Hz is a nice to have feature.- I used to fetch around 7 hours of SOT on my OnePlus 5 but it was a smaller screen. On 7T i never got SOT above 5 hours. The battery life is pathetic. 90Hz is responsible for it. Plus the battery optimization isn't great. Though fast charger makes for it but you just cannot rely on fast charger if ever you are caught in a situation of no power dont expect the 7T to be your saviour.- If OnePlus markets its displays so much then understand the fact that Samsung is king of it. U can usually find similar displays as in 1+7t in samsung M and A series also. No doubt OnePlus have their displays from Samsung.- Camera is another disappointment. I mean sometimes you can pull some great shots then the other time you just cannot believe the kind of bad shots that comes up. People if you are really buying this phone with camera being your priority then please get a mid-range smartphone and purchase a dslr.- Oxygen OS is great no doubt in that and i have no complaints with it. There is only one strange thing that happens is that chrome freezes at times.- OnePlus has never came up with a security solution like Knox by samsung. Data security is a growing concern and demand from the users everywhere but we dont see OnePlus coming up with anything like this. One thing that OnePlus should really focus is on R&D. OnePlus is making huge profit by just selling phones with 3rd party processor, camera, display by investing a little on their OS development.Do read about Samsung Knox and u will know why I am emphasizing on this.Talking about pricing, OnePlus shall soon go out of hands from most important audience- college students, working corporate people who definitely don't want a pricier phone so that it gives them a chance to upgrade after 2 yrs. It already disappointed many with 1+8 absurd pricing. OnePlus has to change their pricing startegy now. 30-40K is where they belong.Recommendation:If you want a worthy phone at 40k+ then better go for s10 lite. 1+8 isn't the phone to upgrade as there's hardly any specifications change and 1+7T shall still suffice your needs. Also, 5G is very far from India getting fully operational for it.

85,4.0 ,"  This is an awesome phone spec wise look wise and over all everything is spot on.I got the phone on 29th thanks to Amazon prime account. First impressions on look is amazing the new forsted sliver is first of its kind in smartphones.Pros:Android 10 out of the box, all software updates was done. 90hz fluid display is amazing you can free the difference with smaller notch. Rear camera performance is good as you accept from OnePlus phones. Nightmode is very impressive I mean you can get pictures in very dark environment with very low light pretty decent. Performance no issues as it comes with 8GB RAM and best chip set in the market. 30WT waap charge is amazingly fast this will resolve the 3800 mAh battery issue, literally it's crazy fast. Almost forgot the new micro camera feature is fantastic you can shot object from as low as 2.5 cm distance ( stability can be an issue ).Lastest oxygen os simple and fast as always. This makes the phone one of the best in this prize range. Almost missed the back cover is also of good quality 👍 for that.Cons:3.5mm jack missing- biggest for me as I have a great headphone for same.No usb-c to 3.5 jack donggle is provided.Selfie camera could have been better ( can improve with software updates )Camera bump for some ( okay for me )

Also it applies beautification automatically. There is no option to disable beautification. Also there is no setting for depth control in portrait mode, you cannot change the depth.The batteries drains out fast when you connect headfones through Bluetooth. Processing power is good but camera quality and battery life is a major drawback. Rather than this but Samsung Galaxy 10 series.

92,5.0 ,"  Editing after 3 weeks of usage of the replacement. Apart from the camera design, the phone proves to be a wonderful package. Asusual a 5 star performer from Oneplus.Delivery took a week's time. After the long wait was eager to check the triple camera setup. When i took pics in wide the too right quarter of the image was too much hazy. First i thought it was some dust in front of the cam. After a close examination could find a dent or scratch over the wide angle lens. This was causing a hazy picture. When i tried to replace the phone with amazon, they are not right away doing it and said there will be a technician at my door step in 3 days time to check on the issue. Based on his report the phone may be replaced. This is not fair, already i waited a week to get the phone and again i won't be able to use it for another week 😣.I have been an oneplus admirer right from oneplus one and this have never happened with oneplus. My request to oneplus to tighten up the quality check before packing the priduct.A minute dent is making me wait almost 20 days to use your oneplus7t.Rest of the 2 cameras are super good. Macro is extraordinary and night scape has improved a lot.And focusing on my issue im uploading few pics. Check the top right corner for the haziness.Amazon please arrange the replacement as soon as possible. I may change my rating to 5 star once i get the good replacement.

Today is the 3rd day of my phone, it is too big to handle, heavy. Worst cases are: When you play games, the speaker splits the music. The phone freezes. Hangs multiple times. When tried returning or replacement, the Amazon technician says, a branded phone worth 40000 cannot be bad. It is my worst nightmare after spending this much, if no one is available to resolve your problem or atleast look at it!

"
96,2.0 ,"  I will tell you that things, which no user & no Youtuber tells you.MY DEVICE IS NOT DEFECTIVE & NOT HAPPENED ANY ABNORMAL ACTIVITY.My review is based on usage of more than Six months.OVERALL LOOKS: Slim, Premium, Reduced Notch & less Bezzles, 190gms weight, but colour options are not good.HARDWARE: Someone may be impressed by its specifications BUT THE SCREEN USED BY ONEPLUS IS NOT QUALITY TESTED. Screen is having many issues not only with my device but with mostly all users. I have read comments of many users complaining about same in Official OnePlus Community app. They went to Service Centre & technician said, it's Normal & this colour tinted problem will not increase. YOU MAY GOOGLE ""SCREEN ISSUES IN ONEPLUS 7T"".Screen is showing different colours in different parts of screen, when Dark mode(Grey) & screen light 20%, is applied. Grey theme is used in Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Whatsapp (instead of Black theme)SOFTWARE: I purchased Oneplus 7T, considering it's Bloatware free Oxygen OS. But I dislike this OS among all other mobile OS. It is having bugs at lockscreen, Dark mode, Phone app & various other annoying issues.Dark mode in low light causes the icons & text hazy due to black area around icons & text. When you scroll page or any icon, you can feel that black background is overlapping the texts & icons.CAMERA: Above Average, No 4k recording & Blurred effect from front Camera, 960fps Slow Motion still not available. Sharpness lacks  sometimes in images.BATTERY: Average. 3800mah. Due to 90hz refresh rate, battery drains quite fast, however 60hz option is available under settings.HEATING ISSUE: Many users in Community App, are complaining about Heating issue in 7T, while Charging & playing the phone. I m not a Gamer but yes it gets heatup quietly sometimes while charging.I purchased it for Rs. 37,999/- but now regret. Even no one can identify the problem in 7T unless they use it, because specifications & price are no doubt very goodI will NOT recommend ONEPLUS DEVICES to anyone. They don't have expert R&D TEAM for Hardware & software testing & optimization.

97,1.0 ,"  The phone hanged and went dark for like 10-15 minutes. It had a black screen and nothing was working, not even the switch on/off button. It has not even been 10 days, maybe I have just got a defective piece but utterly disappointed.

"
98,4.0 ,"  Unboxing experience is not good because of in-the-box accessories (there are none). Not asking for an earphone but at least a Type C to 3.5mm Jack was expected.Coming to phone. It is fabulous.Screen - Personally coming from QHD display to FHD Amoled display, I can't see the difference. 90Hz refresh rate will make you feel other phones lagging.Build - Build quality is good. Gorilla Glass at screen is good enough to handle little drops. Back glass can be fragile. Use this phone with a case and take it out of it sometime to praise it's look.Performance - No words.Camera - A lot of playful modes that you can try, shooting macro shots is great, video stabilization is good, 960 fps slow motion is also coming to this phone. Photos turns out great, but Colors are not natural. Hope they can fix it with updates.Speakers - Loud and clear.Network Connectivity - Cellular reception is very good, WiFi strength is also good. I am able to use WiFi where my previous phone struggled.Haptic feedback - OnePlus claims they have improved haptic feedback on this phone. They might have done it, but there are better phones out there with better vibration. From my experience, vibrations on this phone is thin but instant.Charging - Warp 30T is very fast. Charges to 100% in about an hour. Some people here are confused regarding the charging brick because they were expecting WARP 30T branding on the included charger. The internal circuitry inside this phone makes charging even faster, the ""T"" is inside your phone not on the brick, that's why included charger is WARP 30 and not WARP 30T.Oxygen OS - Smooth. No lag, no heating, quick updates, inbuilt app lock and call recorder. The best android fork which is close to stock and have necessary functionalities built in.Verdict : If you are planning to buy a practical phone within 40k budget, get this one, you won't regret.

"
101,3.0 ,"  Great phone, but disappointing nonetheless. Given the price that we pay, the satisfaction is not fulfilling.Pros:1. Great display, 90hz display does wonders. (But you'll get bored of the smoothness within a day, wanting for features more useful, more evident, more everyday).2. Fast charging is fast enough. Thank you for giving it in the box.3. Plus point for the design. Camera design is great compared to the square fiasco by other phones. Back is awesome, both the Colors. Looks very premium. (But surely you'll keep a case, hiding the greatness of the back).3. Oxygen OS is great compared to most other customised OS. Fast and smooth.4. Phone performs without any lag whatsoever with heaviest of usage. (Battery optimisation is not that smart, apps reload quite a bit after minimising and reopening them. Real time messages are sometimes not shown till we open the app say WhatsApp.)5. Great box (no utility though, only the feeling.)6. Cover supplied with the phone may not be beautiful, but is strong enough and has proper cuts.7. Battery is good. (But with 90hz display and possibly heavy usage - obviously, hence bought the phone with 855+ - the battery drains quite quickly. 3800 is less compared to the average in budget phones.) But anyway, it covers the whole day and fast charging in the box is a good move.8. Love the side slider for sound.Cons:1. 3.5mm to C converter not provided. (Should've given that instead of the cover, as cover is a personal choice but the converter is useful to all)2. SIM tray design is very bad. (My SIM tray got stuck on the very first day, will have to go to the service centre, god knows how much they'll charge.) SIM tray should have a lock system which holds the cards intact to avoid such problems. (Network is working fine, just the tray won't come out, so I can't change sim card now. Really disappointed with this issue on the very first day.)3. Camera performance, battery performance, and sound quality is good, but expected more at this price point. (Though fast charger, number of camera types, and stereo speakers are the plus points.)4. Heavy and fat phone, if you previously used slim and light phones.5. Android system utilizes almost 28GB of storage. (64 GB version is not present for a good reason.)6. Somehow, not that satisfied or happy after getting the new phone. It's a great phone, but still I feel a bit overcharged due to the cons faced.I believe, all utilities should be provided out of the box, for example 3.5 mm converter, or c-type earphones, or wireless earphones, fast charger, lens cleaner and glass cleaner, etc. And all personalization accessories like covers, screen guards, lens guards, stickers, etc can be purchased by users themselves. This increases the overall utility of the box bundle.Here I'm purchasing an already expensive phone and then paying several more for some really necessary accessories.

I have requested a replacement and I'm hoping that the next phone I get doesn't have this issue, it's a shame that YouTubers and other reviewers don't mention design flaws like these, in an otherwise awesome phone, this display is a sore patch. Anyone planning on purchasing this phone must know this.

106,5.0 ,"  The best oneplus yet. Much improved as compared to its predecessor, op7. Even if someone has op7, its well worth upgrading to the op7t.Pros:1. The latest hardware along with the latest software.2. Display. Absolute stunner of a display3. Camera quality. Probably not up to latest iPhone & pixel levels but it’s only a whisker away from them.4. Design & looks. Reduced notch, increased screen size, matt finished glass back, choice of colours of the back.5. Sound quality from phone speakers.6. Oxygen os. Android 10 out of the box.Cons:1. No 3.5mm Headphone jack. No headphone included with the phone.2. Battery back not as good as op7, mostly due to bigger & faster refresh rate screen. However battery back is more than average. This con is basically nitpicking.The hardware & software this device offers for the price it is asking for, is almost unbelievable. Price to perform ratio of this phone is probably the best in the market right now. For me it is. Disposed the op7 in favour of op7t coz it was well worth the upgrade.I would highly recommend this device.

If you are going to use it for gaming purpose, then this device will heat up in just 20-30 mins. Didn't expect it from OnePlus. The battery backup is not that good. But the wrap 30T charger makes up for it. Overall it's a good phone, but not for gaming.

""Tap to Wake"" function doesn't work most of the times. You will have to press the power button to wake up the phone.2. The ""Ambient Display"" function wherein the phone wakes up upon picking it up also doesn't work 80% of the time.REALLY FRUSTRATINGNo worth 40k price tag just for a Big screen and 3cameras.I doubt if d screen wud work for 1year also.Oneplus should come with solution if they actually care for Indian customers.Waste of Money

I compared it with iphone 11 of my colleague, guess what? I felt lags in the iphone11 animation. It was nowhere near to one plus 7T display smoothness. Its hard to revert to 60hz display.For people boasting iphone 11 camera performance, i would say its marginal not as hyped.If iphone 11 scores 100 then i would give 97 to one plus 7T in photography.Iphone 11 is definitely better in videography.But genuinely one plus 7T camera is better than other and compete with flagship.I would say "" 19-20 ka farq hai"".Come to speakers.Loud and clear, you will enjoy every sound from the device. One of the best speaker in flagship.Vibration is significantly improved from last one plus generation and its one of the best among flagship.Screen fingerprint print is stupidly fast and face unlock is insane.Only consCoz its 90hz display its obvious it would consume more power.Battery backup is average, but warp charge come to the rescue. Fastest and coolest charging

114,3.0 ,"  I'm not a gamer. Mostly I used my phone for taking photos, calling, browsing and handling office works. I liked Oxygen OS. it awesome (like Android one + additional features). And high-end performance (High-end processor + 8 GB). 90 Hz display is good. So I gave rating 3 stars in one month of experience.Negative1. Camera # 2-star rating.Landscape + sunlight (12+48) -  Giving very very poor low-level performance, I expected. Producing high boosted images (a Mixed form of colour+ contrast + sharpen) and autofocus also not giving better performance. (I uploaded a sample image taken from back camera without any edit). Night group photos are good (Mostly ppl won't take photos on the night, it's the rare case).  2. Heavy weighted, body size and round camera body - It not comfort for men's pants pockets. Default to care for the camera.3. USB C type to Jack 3.5 audio - Very small size and expensive item. (It's free with Oneplus 6T) 4. Then they are changing prices day by day. I expected Oneplus to have brand value. It's will reduce the goodwill of the company soon. I think all Chinese devices have the same quality. Conclusion - Better to take Google Pixel. Mi phones are also good for photography. But hardware quality is not. I won't promote OnePlus 7t. Please don't trust youtube comparison video makers. They are promoters.

Reason are:-- Never in last couple of years have i faced any heating issue with Oneplus 5,6,6t until i purchased 7t- 90hz screen refresh rate really ?? When you pack high end features relatively low priced phone (although with SD 855+) it results in screen flickering, hanging problem, and heating at the back- Despite having same can setup as 7pro ( my best frnd's) , it is quite noticeable that the pics aren't that sharp and detailed once zoomed in and seen later- Quick charge yes but quick draining of battery charge? Not a Oneplus thing despite of 3800 mah batteryI wish i could have been able to return phone but Amazon policies suck.

120,5.0 ,"  The brand has delivered once again. I have been using the OnePlus 7 before this. But the 7T is not just an incremental upgrade. It has much more to it. Let's start with a few key differences between the OnePlus 7 and 7T1) The vibration motor has now haptic feedback. Much better than linear motor on op 7 and almost similar to OP7 Pro. I love it.2) The phone is slimmer and has a better feel in hand though bigger but has a more sharp corners which adds decency in contrast to rounded corners on OP7. Also notch size is reduced.3) the cameras. Well everyone knows about the cameras. I would like to say that the macro lens that uses the ultrawide lens, is not just a gimmick. It can take photos of fabrics that even the eyes cannot see.4) the smoothness of 90hz screen is just really good to experience.5) The antutu benchmark score. 400000 in comparison to 370000 of oneplus.6) the dual speakers. The ear piece speaker has now higher volume than bottom speaker. On the 7 it was opposite. Also 7t's sound is slightly richer than 7.7) Well the warp charge 30T really adds up. It charges the phone from 0 to 67 in 30 mins. And 0 to 100 in 61 mins. Saves a lot of time. Whereas the 7 takes 86 mins.8) it comes pre installed with Android 10. So 2 Android updates are guaranteed. Whereas 7 came with Pie. Most likely to get an update less.Well now the cons:1)I got a little defective piece. The screen adhesive was slightly visible on left hand side. So opted for a replacement.2)  The wifi sometimes disconnects and thrn reconnects on its own. Maybe a software issue. OnePlus might fix it soon.Well got it for 36k from Amazon. A must buy phone. Cannot keep myself from recommending. Kudos to OnePlus.

121,5.0 ,"  Been a loyal OnePlus user for a long time. Got a great deal and so ordered by trading my OnePlus 3T. Received the phone today and had random restarts, screen freezes and blackouts. Even while setting it up the first time had a screen blackout, later after using it for a few mins it started to reboot randomly for no real reason. The phone didn't have any damage, but I believe am the one who got a rare faulty item. Reached out to amazon over phone, had to wait in queue for like 20 mins, then customer care rep understood the issue and scheduled a Service Visit to check the issue, post which if he determines its a faulty unit I might get a replacement new phone. Will update review and rating post that.Update 10-10-2019:After a lot of struggle and blockages, finally got it replaced by Amazon. Thanks to Nitu from Amazon who helped me out. The replaced device was new one and works as it should, so fluid and stable. Lovely device. Also installed OnePlus care app and claimed the complimentary extra 1 year warranty, if you guys haven't done it, you should.

122,1.0 ,"  Im a COMMON MAN who is living in Kancheepuram,Tamil Nadu , India . I was using oneplus phones for last 6 years ( Op 3,5t,6 ) . Recently I bought ONEPLUS 7T from AMAZON for 34k on JUNE 3 . I was using stable version oneplus on June 3 and 4 . In stable version the phone was heating while gaming and also playing videos . I checked the temperature with the app cpu temperature shows more than 50°c and 43°c with battery temperature . I updated to stable to open beta and checked and the phone is heating the same . Thus I decided to go for replacement with Amazon .I called Amazon for replacement of the device upto 6 to 8 times and 2 times I got hang up obvisiusly. The replies and the solutions they recommended I will mention below ( by Amazon tech agents )1. They told me to download an app called BLANCCO DIAGONOSTIC ( this app got 1.8 stars in playstore ) because they recommended this app for testing the device remotely and it came normal as 37°c as im not doing other than voice calling in phone and they tell me that if the TEMPERATURE CROSSES 47°C only and I can replace the phone . ( Common man voice : How a phone will get 47°c ? Is 43°c for the new phone is not enough for a replacement )2. One of the agent telling me that I should play the game and watch videos and call them at the same time to the Amazon customer service and go to that app and test and show the temperature ( Common man voice : how can I keep the temperature same then they are making me to wait for a call 3 to 5 minutes everytime )3. In covid-19 situation , told to visit the service centre at vellore ( 75 km away from my place ) and make them to test the device and get the job card that the device is faulty and then they are ready for replacement . ( Common man voice : How can i go without epass and I want to spend day in this situation for the fate that I bought the Oneplus brand phone I trusted 6 years )4. At last I tried talking to a Amazon techician Mukesh and his higher authority named Nisha on JUNE 7 for more than a hour requesting for device by showing them in Amazon support email complaint and attachment ( I sent before a day and I got no reply other than computer reply )  and they replyed the same that I should go service centre or I just register pick up & drop .Inbetween they told me many troubleshooting methods and make me format my phone two times within two days .At last I thought someone will help from Oneplus service . Here it goes their replies for 5 calls :1 . Go to service centre or Pick up drop service  and give the new device to them and inspect and then when they think there is fault they will think about it for replacement or repairing it or changing the software . ( Common man voice : New device heating with 43°c with screen shot and photo is not enough as evidence for them to replace )2. Why Amazon is giving 10 days replacement policy for oneplus devices when they don't want to replace when there is heating complaint from a customer and oneplus agent told me to ask to Amazon tech support ( Common man voice : Oneplus instructing not to replace product and how the Amazon take all the blames )There is conclusion here that AMAZON TECH & ONEPLUS are partners in every way when they want to neglect the customer when it's comes to complaint and services .Thank you Oneplus and Amazon for a nice after service and I'm going with consumers complaint with all the evidence I got if I don't get the replacement when the screen shot is not enough for my replacement .Please Be aware Oneplus fans ...

Yesterday I received a new device and it seems the battery life is even worse than the previous one.

Some people are giving less stars because they didn't receive the ""big box"" which they saw on YouTube which is stupid because that was a review unit packaging sent to reviewers by OnePlus 8-10 days prior to the launch. Obviously we don't get all of those things. Also, someone wrote that we get a Warp Charge 30 charger, not 30T inside the box.

Somehow all the three factors aggravate the condition even more. Will look up for a replacement. If the issue still persists, might go for a complete refund.Edit: I've returned the device as of now. Waiting for the replacement product. Still not dispatched.

136,1.0 ,"  I initiated a return for this product as there are some camera glitches. When replacement and return was initiated there was IMEI mismatch due to which my product was taken and was put on hold with no status change. And today when they returned the product back to me saying there is imei mismatch they cannot accept it,  I found out that the imei they were carrying was of another product samsung m30s which i bought together with my oneplus 7t. Such a great negligence by amazon and a havoc they have created by their pathetic service. Worse than ever. They are troubling the customers for no reasons and i think have trained all their customer executives to just assure the customer with their words & fill their survey will shinning colours and no action takes place.

I got message that ""Product is out for delivery"" 2 days but the delivery guy didn't call or came to deliver on either day and by night I used to get message ""Delivery attempted"". I never wanted the product to get back to seller after 3rd fake delivery attempt, so I went to electronic city warehouse to get the product myself (as customer care people were also useless). It was horrible there, The security guard treatment was like I'm thief, he is the busiest guy in the world and I have whole time of this world. He was shittiest guy I ever met; somehow I got hold of a responsible person who helped me to get the product. And Irony is no action will be taken against the delivery person who falsely updates system of delivery attempt and the security guy.

All of a sudden yesterday, it fell of the bed and screen which is claimed to be gorilla glass 5 had 2-3 linings, despite the fact that it had front n back cover.

Disappointing display and quality 90Hz refresh rate is of no use, Oneplus 6 display is far superior. Though the specs of 7T says fluid AMOLED, it doesn't feel so.Only positive compared to Oneplus6, way older version of it is it's camera. Camera quality has been improved.Front camera has not been changed at all, it is still same old one with same old quality.Camera has still same old issues of getting hanged and making phone unresponsive unless you reboot it. If you forget to reboot it will make all other apps hang, including your default message app.Wrap Charge is ok, but bot up to the expectation.Speaker Quality is awesome.Videos at 4K gives over saturated colours  and doesn't look good at all.Horrible part of this phone is it's navigational gestures, older version navigation gestures used to be so cool.Somehow in my phone autorotate is not working properly, may be the issue with my phone sensor.

142,5.0 ,"  A nice product to invest your money. Everything awesome. Mainly I bought it for Snapdragon 855+ processor. There is no lag when I play in PUBG and 90 HZ display is one of the key features for gamers. Fnatic mode is a very good feature for gamers. The camera quality is wonderful. I was redmi user. When I switched tp One plus,I can feel the difference. The battery is the main issue. 3800 mah is not enough. But we have the 30W warp charger support to fulfill that problem. I really amazed at how this mobile charges my phone from 0 to 100% within 1 hour.  Why oneplus does not provide connector in the box.There is no 3.5mm jack in this mobile. SO we need type C to 3.5mm jack adapter for use your wired headphones. Audio quality wise, it is really nice one. Dual speakers with stunning sound quality. Currenlty I am playing PUBG without headphones only. You can feel the sound difference. Sound is the important factor in PUBG. Better puchase adapter from Oneplus store Lockdown time, we can't get it. Limited places only, they selling their products. Dsiplay quality is amazing. 6.55 inch Fluid AMOLED display. Mainly I bought this phone for processor and display only. Amazing quality. For PUBG players, gyroscope works better, There is latency time ! That's all.

Now coming to phone it is awesome device but software bugs are there which I hope will clear over a couple of updates.1. Camera is fantastic. Addition of ultra wide and telephoto is good. But 2* zoom and super macro are just Ok nothing very special. This time camera placement is different aka Motorola. May be you like it or hate it. Nightscape has been improved pictures attached.2. Fantastic display with 90hz refresh rate but no option to hide notch.3. Battery backup is ok, warp charging is awesome.4. Fingerprint scanner is ok. Though Not so fast and convenient as rear mounted scanner.5. A good quality pre applied screen guard and in box cover (looks better than cover supplied with one plus 6) are good. Though aftermarket covers are not available right now.6. Processor , Ram and storage there is nothing to talk about they are best in class.Edit1: with software update there is hide notch option, but implementation is bad. Adjacent area of notch is not used all like previous options. Better use notch or third party app.

Because I couldn’t use this even for a min.Attention: One plus /concern amazon team.This was My 4th one plus, utterly disappointed with the unboxing.Major fault in hardware I guess. Tried 3 to 4 times . Firstly Google a/c , apps ( playstore) failed to start & a/c restoration failed with a lot of unexpected reboot. Next attempt was just couple of reboot.Third attempt was possibly the worse. (video attached) Goggle a/c got recognised, failed to restore cloud data and the screen starts going on n off randomly. No app responded, apart from settings icon. During all these attempt the mobile was like a hot brick out of a oven. n battery drained like a hell.

152,1.0 ,"  Please don't buy this mobile. It's just a month and camera has conked off. Since it wasn't within replacement period, I need to go to external vendor for replacement/service. I had OnePlus 5T and got this in exchange thinking to upgrade. But never thought I would be cheated with this pathetic quality. How can such costly and OnePlus phone can blank out with camera and other in built apps. As mentioned in OnePlus community, I checked for alternatives, was told to erase and go back to factory reset mode. Did it twice but no use with blacked out apps. I seriously doubt the quality of OnePlus now. Lost faith in this brand.

"
153,3.0 ,"  So After research on youtube for last couple of months to upgrade my OP3T ended up buying oneplus 7T . Its been 48 hours with the phone and i feel the phone is not VFM. The reason lies with the other excellent phones under 25K which can provide 90% of this performance. Beyond 25K, law of diminishing returns kicks in. If you still decide to spend 40K for an android phone and ok with mediocre camera you can buy this eyes closed. The details of my observations are as below.Ergonomics and Build qualityThe phone is Huge.This is not deal breaker as we get used to this eventually. The build quality is good though we can see most of the phones beyond 15K started having decent build quality.So no points to OP since we are paying premium for this.The camera setup may not look great, but who cares since it is on the back of the phone. The pre applied screen protector doesn't server any purpose except that we don't need to buy the screen protector/tempered glass immediately. It buys you some days. It doesn't matter if its blue or silver as we all cover them up in cases or skins.DISPLAYThe Screen quality is good(Read Not Excellent) and AMOLED colours are accurate except for the Whites. The whites are not accurate like in any other AMOLED panel. Dark mode is the savior though.Wonder why phones these days are trying to look like shilpa shetty,tall and slim. I am 16:9 guy so didn't like this 20:9 aspect ratio.The 90HZ panel is excellent however there are very less games which could use this. For ex the famous PUBG can give 60FPS at max. The phone creates the perspective of super snappiness because of this 90HZ. Combining this panel with SD855+ makes this phone an excellent performer. The phone does support HDR on netflix ,however i did not find any breathtaking difference with that in the video qualityCAMERA There is nothing great to talk about this camera quality, Average at best.THe photos doesn look detailed, Sharp. We cant choose the resolution and cant take 48MP photo. I know MP is not everything but this helps to crop and take good prints. The wide angle and telephoto lens addition is a good thing,attracts the people who beleive in Specs but not in actual performance. The photos from these phone are a slight improvement from my OP3T which is not so positive thing considering 24K K20 pro provides similar or slightly better photos. Google Cam is not that stable so we have to wait for updates from oneplus.The MACRO mode is also a good addition which we might use it in initial days and  eventually forgot that this even existsSoftwareThis is where Oneplus excels and will make any other android phone bites the dust.The UI is intuitive and no qualms about it.Onplus is good at providing updates on time and should be fine with the support for next three years.AudioThe audio from loudspeaker is good and as everyone know there is know headphone Jack. I feel how important this Headphone jack is,especially when i started using this phone. I am yet to use the phone with BT headphones. Would update the review when i use it with my M50s.Overall SuggestionIf you decided to buy a phone list down top 5 features you need/want in a phone. If camera is listed in top 2, Do not buy this phone. Period.

156,5.0 ,"  I am using this phone from last one week. My experience is Fantastic.1. Looks is great. It looks Amazing in hand.2. Colour is good. A little bit downside from the 7.3. Screen - Best in category. At 90HZ it just feel amazing to touch it and scroll trough it. Its smooth and vibrant. You have to use it to feel it.4. Camera - great. Improved from the older one due to improve hardware. Still some improvement required and I thick Oneplus will do it through patch. I have tool some pictures in different condition and Image production is Great. I really loved the macro mode. Still not the top notch but one of the best produced by Oneplus.5. Speaker - Dolby sound. Sound through speaker is good even at high end.6. Battery - Good back up but it may be improved in future models. When you have phone with 90HZ then it will drain the battery fact, hence more battery power is required. Once plus should have used 4100mAH battery. But still one charges is enough for one day. And you also have Warp Charger and it is faster than the Dash. So not to worry about it.7. Processor - Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+. It works very smooth. Multitasking is easy with it. With new GPU, it work well for all Games. You can play any Game without any lag.So, overall the best phone of 2019...You should buy it without any hesitation...You will not be disappointed.

The triple camera is just perfect to capture moments. Few cons would be some enhancement of zoom in night mode and a better potrait mode camera.* The processor is too good, apps run very smooth and switch between apps is also smooth.* Battery I'd good, normal/average usage would last 12-18 hours. Videos and gaming woudl eventually reduce this duration.* Warp charge is good, personal experience of 53min charge from 12% to 100% - charger could be used while gaming.* With a budget of 40k rupees, i would recommend this phone.

"
166,5.0 ,"  I bought the device few days back and what I feel is it's absolutely worth the money. The build quality, the heptic, the software are all it's best part. The stock camera is not that good but as you know good photos can be the outcome of some trash camera also if you are good enough to take decent pictures. ( You can seamlessly install gcam and use it)The battery life is where I think OnePlus little bit stumbled upon. In daily usage ( no heavy gaming ) I get around 6 hours of sot which is pretty good actually with this 3800 mah battery. But sometimes it feels that the battery is draining too fast but again that can be fixed via software updates. The 30 watt fast charging is just a relaxation ! You don't have to worry about your battery getting charged in time if you forgot to switch on inspite of plugging in ! No heating during charging ( The power break becomes hot although). ( Don't use your smartphone for heavy tasking during charging, then it might get hot )The fingerprint scanner is also good not the best but good. Sometimes it denies to accept my thumb ! The phone never overheats imo. ( Although if you keep your brightness max with 90hz in bright sun and play with camera or do some heavy task then it might get hot enough to worry )The software is one of the main plus point of OnePlus. It comes with android 10 out of the box so it will definitely get 2 major android upgrades and 3 years of bimonthly security patch updates.Overall coming from my 3 and half years old redmi note 4 to this OnePlus is making me enjoy my phone once again. The device is definitely worth for you if you want flagship grade performance with least amount spending.

175,1.0 ,"  I was looking for a replacement of my 3 year old iPhone 7, with a better battery life, a premium brand and a good camera phone (which can have telephoto, wide angle & good picture in real world, not demo pics)...Every dam review online suggested oneplus 7T over pixel 3 or iphone XR (doesn't want to stretch my budget to more than 40k for iphone 11). This phone camera doesn't have 16:9 mode, so watching them on TV shows unused black screen (this is a major use case for most of us).I am using Nikon D5300 DSLR for almost 5 years, but occasionally want to use a good camera phone for family pictures. So, in that hope, i purchased this phone.  But when we compared some photos taken from iPhone 7 & this phone on Sony Bravia android 4k TV, iphone 7 photos/videos seemed much more natural and pleasant than this phone. I tried to use Google Camera as well as oneplus Pro mode, but still unable to beat iphone 7 in terms of photo quality. Obviously, iphone 7 doesn't have telephoto & wide angle cameras and have lower pixel rating. So, I believe iphone XR must have much better quality.Other features of mid range phone is also comparable at much cheaper price (Samsung m30s, Redmi Note 8 Pro, Realme XT have very similar features), so whats the point of this hyped oneplus brand.Also, I am not gamer, so a phone within 6"" display is much more pleasant, but still went ahead with this heavy & large size phone (6.5"", forget to operate it from single hand & more seems like carrying a tablet all the time), just for a good camera sake, which is also not up to the mark.Now I have stuck with this phone, as Amazon & oneplus has only replacement policy in India, but these same companies have 15 days refund policy in US & UK (so much bias towards India, where they sell most of these units). There has been only 3 days, since I received this phone. If anybody interested in purchasing it, I can give it away at reasonable discount.

"
176,5.0 ,"  I have been using the 7T for over a week and this phone by far is the best android phone I have ever used, period. Right from the unboxing, the experience given by OnePlus is different from other brands. I'll divide the review into Pros and Cons and hope they help in making a decision:Pros:1. Display: The display is absolutely delightful to watch movies,videos, play games. The colors are vivid, bright and the flat screen makes it easy for typing and one hand usage.The 90Hz refresh rate though drains the battery faster than usual . So on normal usage, it is better off with 60Hz as no noticeable difference is seen.If you want the phone and display to be even faster than usual (Yes...It is actually possible !!!), activate the developer options on the phone (Click 'build' option 5-7 times) and reduce the animation speeds to 0.5x and see the magic happen.2. The processor: Snapdragon 855+ chipset can pretty much handle almost every app available on the google playstore without breaking a sweat ( maybe generate some heat). Games are just super smooth with default settings being set to HD and the Fnatic and gaming mode only improve it. The processor does tend to warm up over usage and hopefully a software update can sort things out.3. Camera: The camera is by far the best in this price range. I have seen my friends use K20 Pro and Samsung A series phones but this is on another level. Almost DSLR level photos especially at night with nighscape mode and postcard photos with macro mode. Only grouse is that on zooming the photo tends to have little noise but the EIS and HIS take care of this. Ultra wide photos and video(especially the super stable mode) are also seamless and offer great quality and audio.4. Fingerprint scanner: The in display finger print scanner is also very fast and it also detects your finger when the screen is slightly wet also.5. Speakers: The speakers on the phone offer almost portable speaker level quality of sound because of dual speakers. The sound is clear although a little distortion can be seen at higher volumes.6. Charging: True to its name the warp charger charges the phone at warp speed. 0-100% can be charged in just over an hour and around 30-35 mins of charge can easily make the phone last the whole day.7. UFS 3.0: The data transfer on this device is also blazing quick. one can transfer GBs of data in some minutes and the decent storage only adds to the delight.Cons:1. Still no headphone jack: OnePlus has learnt the art of charging more for less. They have removed the 3.5 mm jack from OP6 and it is sorely missed. Type C earphones are expensive and one has to be careful to not lose them. They do not even provide a type c converter as they used to on OP6.2. Battery life: 3800 mah battery with a power hungry SD 855+ processor does not make for a great battery life. It is decent at best. It will run for almost 12-15 hours on moderate usage before charging.3. No converter or earphones: For the price OP is charging, they should have given at least a type c converter leave alone a decent set of earphones when phones at half this thing's price offer earphones.4. The back panel: Although NOT A CON, the back panel is very smooth and slippery and the phone easily falls out of hand. It's recommended to not use the phone without a case.However, all these cons are not much dealbreakers to the experience and the feel that One Plus has given to the 7T. It is much better not only than the 7 but the 7 Pro and 7T Pro as well which are too expensive (almost 12-14K) for what they offer. The 7T offers the best of both and if you have the budget then no other phone comes close to offering the fluid experience of the one plus 7T

177,4.0 ,"  This is the third time I am editing and reposting the review.The phone is a real beauty. It feels, looks and is a premium device. Performance is awesome. 90 HZ display will make you never wanna go back to 60. Games play nice. Display quality is not high as expected but is never a dealbreaker. Camera is good under proper illumination. Macro feature is outstanding and video recording is also great.Now for the cons: YouTube fit to screen option doesn't work most of the time. Screen freezes while on Youtube and also Amazon prime.Battery drains quickly if you are playing games or even on Youtube. Normal use can give up to 8- 9 hours of battery life but on 90 HZ mode, or gaming or streaming expect only upto 6 hrsHeating is also an issue while on games.

178,2.0 ,"  Oneplus making fake hype.Camera takes blurry and noisy pictures.Capturing picture is slower then my 4 year old ipho e 6s. Very bad experience switching from iphone 6s to oneplus 7t 😔Sometimes apps get hanged need to close the app.Prime video sometimes show black screen only play sound only message showing after resrtart issue will be fixed

179,4.0 ,"  Being a first time OnePlus user, I am actually flattered! Camera quality was great, and the new macro mode was exceptional. Personally preferred the photos from GCam though. 90Hz refresh rate is the best feature and you can blindly give your money just for that. A bit unsatisfied with the battery life, but cant complain as the warp charger 30T charges the phone upto 75percent in just 30 minites.Oxygen OS is my new favorite. Highly recommend!

180,3.0 ,"  Hi guys..... I am using Oneplus 7t for more than one and half month and giving review of my own experiences. I love to use one plus mobile. I heard lot of good things about 7t and most of things about 7t are goods..... So I am going to review it specifically.....1) Battery - 4/10 If you are a mobile geek... You gonna disappoint. I am also a mobile geek and I used it for a whole day and it's battery last for 6 to 7hrs only. I used it very rigorously for one and half month and I got disappointed only because of battery.2) Camera - 8/10....there is one thing you will not find good is the colour. If you will click a photo.... The colour of object will not be natural.3) Facelock - 9/104) Fingerprint sensor - 8/10.....It can be more faster.5) Screen - 9/10  smooth and there is no lagging.... Yes 90 Hz is smoothie but battery is draining very fast.6) Processor - 8/10 It didn't used it for game.... So for general use.... I didn't find any lagging or anykind of problem in it.7) Charging - 9/108) Look - 9/10 Yes it has a premium look and you will realize it when you will hold it in your hand.9) Heating..... I didn't find any kind of over heating..... It will heat very little only at the time of charging.I am giving overall 3 stars only because of battery..... It is very much disappointing from Oneplus.... I never expected that it will do blunder in battery's backup.Things are clearly mentioned as above so rest depends on your choice.

183,4.0 ,"  Starting with the delivery : I received this unit during lockdown before the allocated time. So Thank you Amazon for delivering it before hand! The Box wasn't tampered or torn.... it was intact!Demand : Even after 8 to 9 months after it's launch... this device is still popular amongst us.. even if we compare it to one plus 8. And the Price drop has made it more affordable.Looks and Feel :This device is a style statement in itself. I loved its look at the first instant itself. I'll give 9 out of 10 for its looks. The way it's smooth edges are, the notification key, power button and volume rocker, all stand in their respective place. It feels very light in handHowever the oreo camera might be a matter of discontentment from person to person... but i love it.Smoothness and Performance:Device is very smooth.. thanks to qualcomm motherboard unit. Graphic intensive games and apps run smoothly in it. Just a slight heating when playing in high graphic settings.Screen : Amoled looks elegant with 90 hz refresh rate. It is smooth and having great ppi. and luminous intensity.UI : UI is good and simple and easy to operate. However found the UI navigation hanging at times when we navigate using the full screen setting mode.Earphones : I purchased One plus wireless Z along with this unit and after the oxygen os update... it works great with dolby atmos settings. However i do miss 3.5 mm jack... what's the problem in providing that (wired earphones still exist)Battery : Battery is a pain point .. .. have to charge it every now and then. 3800 mah is very less ..  it gives a lot of hiccups and we have to carry the charger where ever we go.

184,5.0 ,"  This is my first OnePlus device. My cousins have been using OnePlus phones (OnePlus 3 and 5T) since a long time. I was previously using the Redmi Note 4 so the jump to OnePlus was quite a big one for me. From using an entry level phone to buying a Flagship, it was a giant leap. Got great discount on this phone (₹3600 off for exchanging Redmi Note 4 and ₹1700 off on ICICI card). I got the phone on 16th of October and have been using the phone ever since. I'll divide my review between the pros and consPROS:-1. BATTERY LIFE. It may seem weird but somehow because of OnePlus's optimizations, I'm getting a SOT of around 6.5-7 hours. If you really try to kill the battery, then also you'd get a SOT of atleast 5 hours2. PERFORMANCE. This phone absolutely flies. The SD855+ processor is a multitasking beast. No stuttering or lags whatsoever3. RAM MANAGEMENT. The RAM management on this phone is insanely good. Apps never get refreshed. Just don't enable the RAM Boost option in settings4. CAMERA. The cameras on this phone are great. Daytime photos look good with slightly increased contrast. The nightscape mode is just too good. Better than Pixels in my opinion. The Super Stable Video mode is a godsend5. SOUND QUALITY. The stereo speakers on this phone are extremely loud and clear. Dolby Atmos really works6. HAPTICS. The vibration motor on this phone is really awesome. Crisp and Precise7. CHARGING. This phone charges at a crazy fast rate. I get 0-71% in half an hour and 0-100% in 55 minutes8. DISPLAY. That 90hz refresh rate is silky smooth. You won't go back to 60hz again. Every other phone with 60hz refresh rate (iPhone, Note 10+, Pixel 3 XL, Mate 30 Pro etc) feels laggy after using this phone.CONS:-1. SYSTEM STABILITY. There are a few bugs here. The brightness wouldn't go to full even after you have set it to max. It'll take 1-2 seconds extra to go to full brightness. Sometimes, Chrome freezes on its own.2. NO USB-C TO 3.5MM DONGLE IN BOX3. NO EARPHONES IN BOXMISCELLANEOUS:-1. The screen flickers at low brightness. Not a hardware issue. It's the nature of OLED displays. You can't see it with your naked eyes but a camera can pick it up. If it bothers you, enable the DC Dimming feature2. AMOLED displays have a hard time displaying correct images on a dark grey background under low brightness. So no need to panic if you see some reddish or greenish tint on a grey backgroundOverall, This is an awesome phone. No phone is perfect. Each phone has a few bugs. I have already got 2 software updates regarding system stability and camera quality. OnePlus is known to remove all bugs from their phones through software updates so no need to worry if you find some bugs.

185,5.0 ,"  Loved ittt ♥️♥️♥️My first one plus device and I thought of buying Nord.  But after seeing all the specifications of Nord, I prefrered 7T over itt due to camera quality and processor which is better than Nord.And the delivery was good and the delivered product is as described and I loved ittt 😋😋😋Since I got it on an exchange offer I got it just at 28k only.  So I found it as a reasonable one at that money and it's a reasonable phone to buy ♥️♥️♥️♥️ and also a premium phone 🥰

186,1.0 ,"  Received a non responsive product. On initial booting it asked me to choose language and then asked me to 'wipe data and cache'. Strange, Considering that a NEW phone should rake you straight to set up. If that's the FIRST thing a buyer sees, it really does NOT inspire confidence in the user experience.... You know what they say about first impressions. Amazon tech support was not available. More panic set in. I called 1+ tech support and they asked me to go through some trouble shooting mechanisms. Conclusion - the phone is non responsive. Called amazon techsupprt immediately and endured the 30 minute wait time. Thereafter the representative (as friendly and knowledgeable as he may be) said that the tech support team was unavailable and that I should call the next day. This morning I called the amazon tech support and went through the same troubleshooting process again. And the representative initiated the replacement. This phone may be highly acclaimed but such an experience can really leave a bitter taste.... Hopefully the new piece that comes to me now is in fact, new and not just ""soap in a phone box"". I wonder if amazon is responsible or the retailer was trying to palm off some used piece... Whoever it is I hope that this feedback helps change or make the process of buying more fool-proof.

188,5.0 ,"  I not a typical reviewer.It's just my first impression.Using OnePlus 7t for the last two weeksUI is especially so good as it's almost like stock AndroidI personally prefer stock android. That might be the reason why i like it's UI.Till now, i didnt feel any lag even while using games like pubg.I can't say much about camera.. as i didnt use it properly. But still can say its beyond my expectation, ( pro mode which almost help me set shutter speed, iso and all manually.)About sound quality. I use OP bullet z with this phone. And with recent update, sound experience have improved a lot.Battery life is okay. Can't say it's superb. It last for a day on my normal use (a few hours of pubg, whatsapp calls, and other app usage).Will update negetive points once i figure out some.That's all for now.Happy shopping

"
189,5.0 ,"  I don't know why people giving false feedback. This is the good phone from one plus at this price range.I saw most of people saying no handsfree, and hard cover in mobile box but its mentioned in unboxing. so just want to tell those people that please watch that unboxing clearly. Those are review boxes only for that tech person and not a retailer box. also tech persons clearly mentioned this in their unboxing video still people asking the same question and giving wrong feedback for best of the best phone which is very wrong.

191,1.0 ,"  Day 1: Feels premium from every aspect. Just missing the 3.5 mm Jack, else it's a great masterpiece.Day 2: My entire trust in one plus is shaken to see the bugs in my 1 day old phone. Not able to answer or make calls. Lot of latency in fingerprint sensor, also in accessing few drop down functions. I have requested for a replacement but this is utter disappointing to find the device malfunctioning. It was very embarrassing n problematic as I could not answer a few calls at work which were important. One plus has completely let me down. I was much better off with MI I believe.

"
194,1.0 ,"  At start the phone will have a nice touch and feel.But with continue usage there are multiple issue and some things that felt good earlier would also feel useless.1.Gaming experience is not good. In Pubg sometimes the touch would not work like trying to shoot but it will not respond and don't shoot. In COD many times the avatar gets stuck and the game wouldn't respond to touch. On continuous gaming heating is pretty much more than what I experienced in OnePlus 5t. Also the gaming experience was also better in 5t.Coming to network and notifications. I have observed that network quality is less than 5t. Ignoring that if we say it's provider issue. I have observed that when not using phone it is not receiving notifications. When we pick up the phone and use something that invokes internet then we start getting all the notification and messages.Coming to looks.. they won't matter because it is expensive phone so we are going to cover it with some cover for better protection and that makes it bulky which is not good.

"
195,5.0 ,"  I took the phone in the last week of November and got the 128 gb variant for 35k.The delivery was fast and the phone was delivered in good shape.It is pretty much what you would expect from OnePlus. The build is pretty premium. Comes with a transparent case inside. The buttons and screen are sturdy looking although the back and screen do attract fingerprints.The performance on this thing is flawless and is just a bit ahead of the rog2 even though the rog2 beats it in almost every other field. The 90 hertz display combined with the 855+ really defines a new standard of being smooth.Updates are timely and the oxygen OS is the standard vanilla experience although i found the unnecessary Netflix app pre-installed.Fingerprint reader is pretty quick and the camera is good too although the camera gives images slightly on the saturated side.The notch is not much of an issue.The biggest bummer is the lack of an audio jack which i think was a bad move from OP. The phone does not come with a 3.5mm adapter and you will have to buy it seperately. Although the mrp of the adapter is 390, you can enroll your device with your OP Account and get 250 off on it. I got mine for 180. It's not the most comfortable thing to use and does not have a good build quality but haven't gotten any issues yet.This packs a 3800mah battery which combined with the 90hertz display drains reasonably fast. If you don't use your phone a lot during the day it does last for a day and a half but if your screen is continuously on then will just last a day.With complete day on YouTube at 30% i had got 7 hrs of screen on time.But this won't be an issue for you if you can carry the charger. The 30watt wrapt charge is ridiculously fast. It charges from 30 to full in a little over 35 mins. Even a 10 min charge gives me around 30%.One charge in the morning for me lasts till the next day morning with 20-30% to spare.So only pick this phone if you are taking it for long use and for the snappy clean software and performance.If you are planning to take a phone for gaming choose the rog2 over it anyday. Not that it performs better than this. The performance is almost the same but it has a ton more of other features that will matter more.Overall it's a good phone.

196,3.0 ,"  Writing this review after using this device for 6 Months -Pros -1. Super smooth for everyday performance no hiccups anywhere.2. Enough battery life for light to medium usage.3. Very versatile camera setup. You have wide+tele+macro4. Regular updates from Oneplus.5. Oxygen OS has the right mix of stock android and added features.6. Speakers and the display is very good.Cons -1. OnePlus cheaped out on providing a proper cooling solution. This phone doesn't have a Vapour chamber or a  Copper heat pipe. Instead it is using the aluminum frame of the device as a heatsink. What this means to you is that  when you play PUBG/CODM for longer time the phone heats up but from the left side making it very difficult to  hold the device in hand. If you use a case then you won't feel as much heat but you won't get efficient cooling. I  don't recommend this phone for Long sessions of Gaming as this phone lacks in proper cooling solution.2. Battery life is average at best for heavy usage.Edit.3.I got a faulty display that has green and purple tint.

197,4.0 ,"  Penning this review after extensive use of around 10-12 days..Coming from OnePlus 3T user, this is a pleasant upgrade.. 8GB Ram-256GM storageThe main USP of this phone is the display, the wrap charger which is ultrafast and the performance..would never hang up on you despite innumerous apps or games..however I did see a couple of apps crashed at times..The Antutu score is around 3.5L ..which is impressive..Coming to battery, when phone arrived it was at 48pc and took close to 25mins tomfull.charge with wrap.charge..With moderate to heavy usage the battery last for entire day..With the dash charger , takes a little longer but fast enough..Have hardly observed any heating issues with multiple apps open..The biggest let down though is the camera..Immediately after opening the phone from box and configuring it came an OTA update mainly for camera..Took some shots and have extensively used in last few days and shots are just normal not exceptional including the much advertised macro mode..the nightscape mode though is an exception..The auto camera settings are over saturated with red's and yellows are too warm to be real when you view them on big screen ..I hope the OnePlus team updates the camera eventually as.this is purely SW related since the hardware in paper is great and capable of shooting exceptional photos..having said that as of today the camera is equivalent to any phone in 15k-20k range...compared it with M30s and M30s came out to be better in some.occasions under similar lighting...so.if u are truly looking for a great camera don't go for it..Though the front camera was much better and photos came out naturalHowever if u trust the OnePlus communtiy n developerslike me :) this phone is simply amazing with it's screen , performance and battery ..The stock.android like experience is an icing on cake with buttery smooth feel without any lag whatsoever..Good luck!

198,3.0 ,"  If you have used any phone in 20k+ budget, then this Phone is pretty average. I dont obseve anything outstanding as compared to my previous honor phone.Few things i dont like on this phone -Automatic brightness for screen.. this just doesn't seem to be working when i move outdoors. Display is hardly visible with full brightness. I am yet to figure out if i can tweak this thing. Until now, it's a bad experience to use the phone in sunlight.Camera... Not great at all. The only area this phone outperforms is the quality of night-light photos ... Like the diwali lights decor and shooting buildings at night .. small tiny moon in the backdrop... Except these ones.... All other photos are below average, terrible saturation of reds!Image stabilization is very bad. I have used a Moto G4+ in the past for shooting outdoor landscapes at Ladakh while I was riding a bike on those tough terrains.... There were hardly any blur photos. This phone can't even get a decent photo in the hand unless using the 48MP in normal mode. I'm not at all happy abt their Hybrid-Image-Stabilization.Selfie camera is pretty bad too.. cant get a wide angle and depth effect like in other phones.The phone freezes sometimes .. with 8GB RAM? My old phone had only 4GB and never froze once! Something's not going good inside this phone.Missing the 3.5mm audio jack a lot :(Something's i like abt the phone - watching videos indoors.. good display. The faster screen refresh rate is definitely a good experience.Oh, and the warp charger... I just love it!

199,5.0 ,"   Another well made product from OnePlus, I have been using Oneplus series from their First Smartphone and this is my 4th one, 7T has everything speed, display quality, RAM, Latest Android, security, and Oxygen OS smooth as butter, minimal yet fill with futures.I upgraded to 7T from OnePlus 5, which still performs like any of the new mobile available in the market, I miss LED notification in 7T, and the screen is bit too long for my liking, because of the big screen battery backup is not as good as in Oneplus 5, but the Warp Charge makes up for it with quick and fast charging.Overall a good phone for every one.Go get it, you wont regret it.

200,5.0 ,"  Little retrospect. I was using Samsung Galaxy A7 2017 for the past two years. Now coming to this phone.Pros:Very organized software: Everything is intuitive. I was used to samsung experience so this software feels a hell less cluttered. Even comparing to one ui, I feel oxygen os is better.Camera: Simply the best camera u can get at this price point! Night mode, ultrawide, stabilization is all very good.Performance: Snapdragon 855+ and oxygen os. Nothing to say anymore.Battery: Excellent battery optimization. Even though I have pinned some apps in the ram and am a heavy user, 5+ hours of screen on time is consistent.Speaker and call reception: all very excellent.Face unlock: works 100% of the time and is really very fast.Cons:Missing Always on Display: ambient display in one plus serves no purpose at all.Buggy Software: it will seem odd to you but after using this phone for about 2 months i am confused why other people wont mention it. There are some minor glitches that keep appearing in this phone. Sometimes the status bar will just disappear until it's restarted. Gaming mode causes problems with some games, like the moving parts in the game will disappear and won't correct unless the game is restarted. Screen freezes are very common. And some more little things that become irritating over time.Fingerprint scanner: works maybe 60% of the time.If anything is not mentioned, it's because everything else is just fine.

202,4.0 ,"  I ordered it on 20th july but after using it for two days after delivery i felt vibrations at the backside while playing music/videos at half and higher audio levels. I researched about it on OnePlus forums there i found it was a common problem in 7 series but i wasn't satisfied so i asked questions on amazon & people replied that there was no such problem & i have received a defective product so i replaced it & again with the new phone i am facing slight vibrations.The manufacturing dates of both products was also different so i think it's not a hardware problem  but it's due to stereo speakers on top & bottom. I may have felt it more because i had a vivo y53 earlier which was an average product. Other than that i am totally satisfied with the product but i feel irriated sometimes due to vibrations so i will start using earphones much more now.

205,2.0 ,"  GENUINE REVIEW: Quality of One Plus 7t is bad as compared to its previous models + not upto mark as compared to other competitive models.The battery life is poor and I have to charge my mobile in each 5 hours.Both camera qualities are not good. Cannot understand if it needs hardware or software improvement!The memory management is too bad. Although I have quite free RAM memory & storage, but still different apps keep crashing through out the day producing crash logs. Most of the times screen goes black or crash whole OS where you need to reboot the device while playing Amazon video. One day, the mobile got complete blackout and I searched for One Plus community blog and based on couple of other user's instructions and long press on power/volume button to restart the mobile. A mobile device shouldn't behave like this if it is new. I used so many Android devices earlier for atleast 2-3 years and this is the worst one with this higher price.

206,5.0 ,"  I replaced 3T with this masterpiece 7T. I had been using 3T for the last two and a half years and was planning to continue using it for another one or two years as 3T is still a beast as on date but unfortunately my 3T was dropped in a swimming pool and so i replaced my 3T with this amazing phone. When you are accustomed to using Oxygen OS nothing can replace the feeling and satisfaction. I have been using this 7T for last 3 days and i just want to give a quick overview of likes (which are many) and dislikes ( a very few)  as below:Likes:1. Display is amazing with 90 hz refresh rate.2. Android 10 out of the box with new features.3. Excellent photos along with Supermacromode in camera.4. Zen mode with new customizable time periods.5. Butter smooth performance. No lagging or heating at all during multitasking or gaming.Dislikes:1. i am very dissappointed with the Nightscape mode. The picture you take in nightscape is unsatisfactory. Even though the camera manages to take the extra light but it lacks the originality and is less subtle especially when you snap a persons photo in very low light, its felt like colour mush evrywhere. Infact , to my surprise i found that low light photography is very good without using nightscape. Except this, i liked the camera quality very much.2. battery is average may be becoz of the 90 hz refresh rate for e.g on average to heavy usage if i start the day with 100% battery at 7 am , the phone manages to retain 10 to 20% battery by 7 to 8 pm.Anyways , overall i am very happy with the upgrade and glad to be a part of the one plus family again. infact in our family we have OP6, OP6T, OP7 and now OP7T 🤗🤗🥰🥰

209,4.0 ,"  I upgraded from one plus 7 to 7T and it's a good decision, overall thoughts on 7T.At the cost what they are selling it's definitely a good deal.The best part of the phone is it's display and the sound, to be honest, I don't feel any difference between 60 hz and 90 hz and who cares because, the display brightness and color production in 7T is  excellent, the phone when you take to outdoors, the display looks just like indoors because of the excellent brightness levels which is 1000 NITs. You would love watch movies or any content on this superb display.Sound clarity and the volume levels, simply the best, you don't feel like using headphones or need external source. It's so Crystal clear that you often wonder how's it possible to produce such crisp sound on a smart phone definitely better than one plus 7 though both have stereo speakers, this is of a different level.Battery back up is good but I felt one plus 7 was better, yes, it charges from 0 to 100 in 1 hour and the charging port is tad tight.On Camera, yes it has 2 additional lens, one telescopic and one ultra wide apart from primary lens, yes it does do the work of what it's meant for  but the processing is moderate, the noise levels are seen, I felt one plus 7 takes better photos compared to 7t, I might be wrong here.The look and feel is top notch, the Oreo camera actually enhances the looks and I see everywhere people buying blue because that's what the reviewers get from One plus, for 256gb you have only blue color but the fact is that Grey or the Fostered Silver is very Good looking than blue and it looks more premium.The face unlocking and finger scanner is fast, face unlocking does work even in dark with the screen light falling on the face.One not so feel good factor is with the haptic motor, it's week, they shouldn't have rather put it but overall it's very good phone

210,4.0 ,"  I`m writing this review after using 7t  for 11months exactly. 7t is my first mobile of Oneplus. As the sales starting I ordered on the day one itself. Was very excited to have it and thought I reached the expectations.Now comes the total change some kind of discomfort feeling about 7t and it has started after the software update.Receiving of OTP`s stopped and when the phone rings there won`t be notification shown to lift the call(it happened randomly) we have to check in call history after the ringtone ends to know who called.Now about Camera, there are totally four lens one front and three back. In spite of these many lens the images and video quality are just like I don`t know what kind of word I shall use, I think “garbage” is right.Finally I`m selling of my mobile to have One plus Nord. One plus a suggestion from me when you say “we don`t compromise on building quality for our customers” in the promotion, try to make customer feel so in reality.

211,5.0 ,"  I am glad that I bought this OnePlus 7T and it is just amazing!! I assure you , it's the best choice for this price range.What I like is it has nearly all the features that OnePlus 7 Pro gives ( and more including outstandingly better macro camera and Snapdragon 855+) and that too, at much less price. The camera quality is very nice as you can see. Yes it struggles in low light but still, it's much better. However battery is 3800 mAh, still it gives a very decent battery backup at 90Hz because of its optimised oxygen os and fluid amoled display.If you are a gamer, you are going to have a very amazing experience. The graphics are a feast to the eye. It's so fast , I just love it.The Os is highly customisable and you can design it however you want. The Zen mode provides you a break and lets you enjoy life. Reading Mode is fantastic. The look is very premium.Overall, if your budget is under 40k , this is the best choice. Period.

213,3.0 ,"  Since oneplus 3T, I am a regular user of One Plus. I used one plus 5t, Oneplus 6, One plus 7 and now one plus 7t. Out of all I did not like 7T. To be frank, One Plus 7 was much much better than 7T.1. Fingure print censor doesnt work all time2. Battery drains out before noon ( pls note that I dont play games, I dont watch Videos much and I dont play songs).3. Most of the features are repeated from One Plus 7. But rear camera of One plus 7T is much better ( I am not telling one plus 7 camera was bad. It was really good... But this camera is better than one plus 7)4. Speed is best. I have 8GB RAM. Really good.Overall, when compared to 7, 7T is an average phone.

214,5.0 ,"  Writing this review after using it for a day.Camera - No doubt, this is best one for camera. i tried taking pictures in every light(day, night, afternoon) and believe me this stands par from others. Didnt want to carry DSLR for my travels hence landed up at this. I am fully satisfied.Fingerprint sensor - Bit slow but pretty much acceptable. This doesn't mark phone in negative side.Battery - It ran for more than a day for me. I clicked around 50 pics, saw 10 videos, did setup of numerous app in this phone after one time charge and still it ran for more than a day. So, i am happy with that.90/60 htz - I shifted to 60 hts and performance was good enough.Charging - Fastest ever seen.App opening time - Very fast, impressive.Memory- I can see 256 total available memory. So its not like other phones which shows 223 available out of 256 GB.Sound - Excellent. Enjoyed playing videos on YT and Savn app.Earphone Jack - Bought a type C converter from local market(Pimpri,Pune) for INR 80 and it did the job well.Body Cover - It looks like a normal cover. Doesn't hold mobile tightly. I would change that to a better one soon. I see some good covers are launching on 20th October for INR 599. They looks superb and rigid.

215,5.0 ,"  Initially my first choice was to go for the rog phone 2 which had similar price pointsBut then I realized that paying money for the things which we are not going to use frequently is madness.Of course in specs the rog phone 2 looks like a heavyweight.But those are for the people who have never used one plus.First of all,I got my 7t on the Amazon's Great Indian festival which gave me a discount of 2000 RS which is equal to the rog phone 2(yes u get a discount for 2k but it was out of stock)Secondly, both phone's do not support sd card,since that I made one plus 7t my cup of tea.There is a difference between the 90hz and the 120hz display.But why pay for those if u are not a professional gamer.The camera on the 7t is way more good than the rog phone 2.The design is made for professionals and not gamers.Then comes the softwareOne plus 7t ships with Android 10 out of the box which is great.This is the first phone to get Android 10 even before the pixel 4.Then comes the battery lifeI have been using this phone for the past 5 days and I barely charge this device if I am using it at 60hz (that's smoother than the k20 pro).For 90hz display u will get a screen on time of around 6 if u are a regular user.For charging speeds, the 7t gets the wrap 30t which is insanely fast. It took me around 58 mins to charge the phone from 0-100 which is definitely the best in the market.Call quality and signal reception is good even when there is no proper signal reception on my brothers k20 pro.Face unlock is faster and the fingerprint reader is also improved.Oxygen 0s!!!!!! Belive me, If u switch to oxygen os,then clearly u will never back off .For a regular user who does gaming very often, the performance is top notch, the snapdragon 855 plus can handle anything at ease.Overall one plus has offered a complete packageFinally,I have no regrets in buying this phone over the rog phone 2........

216,4.0 ,"  Got it delivered on 23/6/20,i was confused between op8 and 7t. After thinking so much i concluded that 7t is a best pick right now cos Op8 is a overpriced device cos of 5g and believe me in india till now 4g is not working perfectly than how could you expect 5g to come that soon. I guess 5g is not coming till 2 years atleast than why spend 8k extra now? At the price tag of 34k i got SD855+ 90hz display,warp charge,triple cameras which are working really nice as expected. So i think currently its the best device in this price tag. I am disappointed only in the matter of ip rating which is also missing in op8. And one more thing op8 has the curved screen which is very expensive to replace if you break it and curved screens are also very very fragile and they are also prone to accidental side touches. So i think 7T is a much better option than op8 and its even 8K cheaper 😅

220,4.0 ,"  Oneplus is indeed great brand and i am using it for last 4+ years and i am die hard fan of oneplus.I expected oneplus 7T another masterpiece from oneplus but the things are not so great this time.Pros:1. Stylish look with oneplus brand label.2. Smooth touch due to 90hz refresh rate.3. Very high end processor from SD, making it high performer even while multitasking and gaming.4. Great combination including RAM and ROM, which is necessary and making it smooth going for 2-3 years.5. Fingerprint sensor is really good and quick, working very fast and accurate.Cons:1. Finishing is in polycarbon with only side aluminum frame while before lower models from oneplus had metallic finishing.2. Smooth Liquid Touch came at expense of your battery drainage causing battery to drain much faster than expected thus forcing you to keep refresh rate at 60Hz.3. Camera quality is not so good, needs more focus for clicking nuce pics otherwise most of times pics goes blur.4. Face Unlock only scans your iris/eyes only while other competitive brands of oneplus scan your full face and other face points.5. No 3.5mm jack, making your old wired earphones to rust.

221,1.0 ,"  After purchasing, just after a week my phone started hanging on every app. The volume doesn't work smoothly. The camera doesn't functions properly. It automatically shuts off everytime.The keypad isn't functioning smoothly.I have to restart my phone every time the lag is there, so it can function properly.I doubt about it's 90hz processor now.The problem started getting worse from the day the return/ exchange window on Amazon got closed for this phone. I guess that's my bad luck. Now I'm not getting proper response from the seller as well.Highly disappointed!

222,1.0 ,"  I was soo excited today that I would be getting to lay hands on this beast of a phone. Got the delivery promptly as expected and in good package. Ideally I would have liked such items to be delivered in a box rather than the usual Amazon envelope. Though the envelope was sealed properly, probably to avoid any tampering before delivery.I had unboxed it and it had all the items namely scratchless Phone, Good transparent phone cover and charging adaptor and sim removal tool along with other documents.So far so good. Then starts the ordeal. The phone failed to boot and got stuck on the Image1, attached here, for long time. I felt it has entered some recovery mode when on next press of Power button the next options, Image 2, with one reading English appeared. By now I was almost sure there is some issue with the phone but still out of hope, and belief that it can't happen with me, I clicked on English and page as shown in Image 3 appeared. Then I thought against going ahead and called customer service for replacement.I have shared the details with them and they assured me that by end of the day I should be getting the delivery date of replacement phone and this headset will be picked up at the time of delivery. Ideally I would have liked the same-day delivery as their warehouse is very close to my area but the customer service executive mentioned that since it is more than 20k, it would require some approvals.I am now hoping first to get the replacement as soon as possible and that the replacement works well, unlike this one. Really disappointed with OnePlus to have delivered a faulty phone but I am hoping that Amazon helps me out as usual with their prompt and normally very good customer service.Hope to give a detailed review when I receive a working phone and I am hopeful it will happen soon. Once again a shout out to Amazon for prompt Customer service. Hopefully I will get the phone by tomorrow and the mood changes from current gloom state to rejoice.

223,5.0 ,"  ""A thing of beauty is a joy forever'""Jack of all trades, master of all'""Bold and beautiful""""Pure temptation""This phone is so beautiful, elegant and buttery smooth that you will feel addicted to this masterpiece and it will be a cynosure for all eyes. OnePlus has truly shown it's microengineering skills while manufacturing this OnePlus 7t.I did a lot of research for 2 months before buying a new phone. This is true VFM phone.Pros.1. Processor.Snapdragon 855+ is flawless and needs no further description. All high graphic games run ultrasmoothly. Phone automatically shifts to game mode while playing games.2. Display.6.55 inch HDR 10+ fluid amoled 90 Hz display is always vibrant and soothing to view. It has colour enhancement feature for videos and it is amazing.As per me its 6.55 inch size is perfect to hold.Avoid phones of display of 6.7 as they are bulky and difficult to hold. You will never use IPS display again once you will hold this phone.3. Body design/built quality - Ergonomic designed aluminium alloy body with Corning Gorilla glass 5 on both sides. Premium feel in hands. Also it comes with free good quality transparent protector case4. Camera- It is simply amazing. Pics capture the each and every detail of objects. Macroshots are fabulous. (See images). Enjoy capturing the beauty of nature.Slow motion video recording is excellent in natural lighting. Inside the rooms you will notice darkness and screen flickering.5 . Speaker- Dolby Atmos certified speakers both at above and below are loud and gives a mesmerizing experience while watching multimedias.6. Touch response/fingerprint scanner/faceunlock-Phone gets unlocked in a fraction of second. Touch is buttery smooth.7. Haptic feedback- So soothing experience just like an iPhone.8. Battery- Battery is good but not excellent. However 30W wrap charger is so fast that it charges my phone from 0 to 50% in 20 minutes. So battery is not a major issue and I can easily get 12 hours of usage time.Also battery optimization is amazing.I was worried about its battery life before buying it as most of the persons have given bad reviews regarding its battery. But believe me wrap charger makes things simpler.9. Internet, call quality and Wifi- Excellent10.Oxygen OS- Best ever. I was using a mi phone before and miui OS was just very bad. Believe me oxygen OS is without any annoying ads and is so easy to use.11. Extra featuresGray scale- this feature turns phone display to black and white and it looks amazing as well.Side slider switch- It is an added feature like in iphonesCons- Not seen yetFinal verdict- I am not a technical person. I have never bought a phone of more than 18000 in my life. But honestly saying spending 38000 on a 256 gb device like this is worth. It is an Android iPhone...:-)Blindly go for it. I myself had wasted a lot of months on deciding which phone to buy.

224,4.0 ,"  Received my phone 12hrs ago..... Here's my initial impressions. (Was in a dilemma between this and the ROG2... But since I don't game at all and the styling was a bit too loud for my taste, I went ahead with this classic beauty, I spite of the battery life and other obvious advantages).PROs1) Awesome built quality... I like the in hand feel of the phone and it's possible (not comfortable though) to use it with one hand, if ur hands r big enough.2) Screen is amongst the best I've seen and used, (used a super amoled on Samsung previously). There's a screen guard pre installed and I didn't feel the need to remove it as it didn't hinder my fingerprint or input via the touchscreen.3) Software is a total gem.... It's clean and with no bloatware whatsoever.4) I personally like the alert slider... Its quite handy for me.5) Performance is buttery smooth and RAM management has been done well. The apps stay in memory all the time.(I tried with 7 apps open at the same time). Since I don't play games of any sort, I didn't test it out.6) Speakers are good...its loud enough and clear at the same time.7) Camera is a mixed bag. It's good enough for social media and with a lil bit of editing, u can take some real good pics but don't expect top tier level quality. So maybe photo buffs should consider a different phone with a great camera.8) Charging speed is a beast... Nothing else comes close.CONS1) lack of a headphone jack is a real bummer for me... Especially since my Bluetooth headset (Sony Mdr-xb650BT) doesn't seem to connect no matter what I try.2) The gestures are a hit and miss at the moment, maybe it'll improve with time but so far am not enjoying it. And the software buttons, while typing messages u accidentally type the home button which leads to the home screen and makes the typing experience really annoying. So sticking with gestures in this one.3) Battery life could be a problem. I was using it in the 90hz mode when I received it and within 1 Hr battery dropped by over 16%...... So, 90hz is cool and all but I've reverted back to 60hz refresh rate to see by how much the battery performance improves. Will test it more in the following days and decide based on the result.So those are my very early initial impressions. Maybe I'll update after couple of weeks time for a more detailed review.Enjoy the device👍

228,5.0 ,"  My first OnePlus and I am loving it.It's been 4 days I have been using the phone and below are my pros and cons.Pros...1) very good display. For display 5/52) Snapdragon 855+ is very fluid and with Android 10 it works very efficiently. So performance 5/5.3) I know many are complaining about battery life not good however as per my observation if you keep the display at 90 hz refresh rate the battery is bound to be draining fast. If you are travelling and won't get any power socket for many hours I would suggest to keep the refresh rate at 60 hz it will really improve battery performance.4) Charging 5/5. With warp charge 30t the charging is absolutely brilliant.5) Camera 5/5. I have read reviews where people are complaining about camera quality being blur however I have not faced any such issues. It's true that it takes a little bit of time to adjust the focus however the camera samples are pretty good. I even use a DSLR so know a little bit about adjusting the focus. My tip use grid lines for better focussing.6) Looks 5/5. Looks are really premium. However I would suggest anyone buying this phone to compulsory have a good rugged case because it is important to protect this from scratches. It's true a rugged case will make the phone look bulgy but I am ok with that.Cons1) No 3.5 mm jack and OnePlus does not provides an adapter as well in the box. According to me it's an essential item as with the low availability of type c headphones I think a 3.5 mm adapter in the box would have been very helpful.2) video output on phone looks brilliant however when taken to laptop it looks way too much over saturated. My suggestion to OnePlus is to fix this issue with an update because the video performance comes nowhere to the still pictures performance. If the issue is not fixed than it would really dwarf the phones still pics capability and would lead to a bad review.My suggestion if anyone looking to buy OnePlus go for the 7t  without any doubt if you like the looks because looks are subjective to one's personal liking. As for me I love the looks.

"
234,5.0 ,"  This is the fastest phone I've ever laid my hands on. I never thought speed would make such a difference. Mid range phones are very good these days making flagship phones less attractive. But this phone is just so fast, it makes all that extra money you put in worthwhile. This phone will be good for 3 years easily just because of the specs and power. You can directly upgrade from this phone to a good foldable in 3 years. Stock camera disappoints sometimes in certain scenarios but gcam comes to the rescue. You cannot blindly open the stock cam in an urgent situation. Keep both and use whichever you think will suit the situation. That's the only minor problem with this phone. Also the fingerprint reader isn't perfect. I suggest registering each of your fingers twice to improve results. Otherwise everything is perfect. Screen ,battery life, performance, speakers, charging speed, UI, in hand feel and touch response. It's all 5 out of 5! The price is the cherry on the cake. I don't know why people are still buying Note 10s and Pixels. This phone has everything at half the price. I have a pixel too and honestly I liked the software of the Oneplus better! It's that clean. 128 gb is more than enough for most people.For 33K this phone is a steal. If this is your first time with OnePlus and doubting the brand. Just don't. The phone comes with 2 year warranty and free pick up and drop for any service issues. That's the kind of focus the brand is putting in here. So don't worry about the reliability.

238,5.0 ,"  Loving the new OP 7t.Using it since 4 days now.. here are my 2 cents:Looks and feels amazing to hold, grips fine.Proccessing is fantastic, truly one of the best. Multitasking on a smart phone never been better.Display is impecible, 90 hz gives a whole new smooth browsing experience, night mode really helps the eyes for long usage.Camera is one of its best feature for sure, I mean such great image quality and macro mode is a winner. Loved it!Battery is on the lower side but hey wrap charger is so fast that u don't mind that much. 20 mins of charge and  you are good to go. Feels magical how fast it charges.OnePlus could have given basic accessories in the box like headphone convertor. Have to buy them separately.Amazon delivery got late by a day but it's okay.

239,5.0 ,"  Despite of OP 8 series, at 35k OP 7T is still the phone to buy if you have the budget.Pros:1.Display topped with 90Hz refresh rate makes the phone gorgeous & buttery smooth.2.Oxygen Os is simply the best possible android skin out there & is also customizable.3.Camera: I don't know about critics. But this triple lens camera is something. Super Macro mode & Nightscape mode is on another level. Thanks to the 2X telephoto lens. The contrast level is slightly high but I like them nevertheless.4.30T warp charge. The relatively low capacity 3800mah battery can charge up insanely fast. Use a 30 min charge anytime during your schedule & u get a 61% boost up.5.Host of other features like haptic feedback, slider button etc.Cons:1.Durability : be cautious & buy a good protective back cover.2.Battery : Although it gives a 7 hour screen on time which is relatively good & can last a day, for gamers & binge watchers carry a powerbank as backup. This is not a con.Verdict: Hands down this is the best oneplus phone till date.If you need a phone that can lasts longer, perform daily jobs smoothly, takes good pictures this phone is good enuf.Thank you.

It does not recognize the finger at once despite registering multiple times. There are apps which require F/p sign in and they work well. This indicates maybe the f/p scanner is fine but Oxigen OS has some bug. I downloaded Amazon diagnosis software and it detected the phone to be working well. But am still not satisfied with the F/p scanner. It works only in 20% of the scans.

"
242,1.0 ,"  Quality of voice during phone calls. Whether normal, whether speaker or headphones. It is so bad that I don't recall a single call ever with this phone of even half decent quality.Either One Plus 7 T just sucks or I have been sold a fake or one that did not pass quality control so got sold to poor 3rd world souls like me because there is no control or recourse for junk and crap made with jugaad sold in desh.My Motorola X Play was much much better - served me very well with less than half the price for many years. Never had voice quality issues.I regret buying this. Even with battery problem, my old Motorola X-play was much better.

243,3.0 ,"  First time i bought one plus , after delivery i  box and started intialize the phone. During initialize i faced the following problems1. not successfully initialize , it was stuck on updating part. I tried 3 to 4 hours but not sucessed.2. Bettery drain so fast and phone continuously heating.I called amazon care , got no response and  took helpvia chat  but did not get positive response. Finally i took help from one plus care via chat, one plus guided me that first you have to factory reset the phone and then start initialize phone again. I did this and finally phone started to breath.I don't know why factory reset is needed in new phone.so guys this is my experience about phone.

"
244,5.0 ,"  The item is incredibly good. The phone is wonderful. The case given in phone is good with basic protection. Do buy a new case. Try poetic case . Incredibly good, cheaper than UAG case. Poetic case covers the bumper ( the camera bumper ) so good. And it has got all the protection u need in the world.The phone is simply superb. Very easy to transfer files from old phones. All thanks to Android♥️.U get a basic minimal screen protector. Scratches come easily. Do get a good screen guard effectively.In the end.. phone is GEM💎.The photo I uploaded is shot on OnePlus 7t♥️.

"
245,5.0 ,"  Pros : 1. Premium design - all glass and metal build which looks awesome and feels very premium in hand.2. Oxyzen OS - it was the prime reason why I switched from poco F1 to OnePlus and it certainly didn't disappoint. Absolute joy to use this device due to clean and almost stock andriod experience with nice customisations.3. Speakers - The dual stereo speakers are of top notch quality and you will never use in maximum output and still it's more louder than other flagsip devices.4. 90 hertz refresh rate - Another deal maker is this utterly smooth 90 hertz refresh rate which is the best thing in OnePlus devises. Use it to believe it.5. Camera - Better than expected rear facing camera which produces crisp and detailed pictures in both daylight and lowlight conditions. Selfie camera are also good.6. Screen and sensors - The fluid amoled screen is just a treat for the eyes. All the sensors are working blazingly fast like fingerprint sensor and face unlock but missing the ir blaster.Cons: 1. Battery life - Battery life is not that great will last for a day in moderate use. But the warp charger will fill the juices blazingly fast so not a deal breaker.2. Camera bump- although the design is solid and cool but there is a slight tilt when u keep the phone in flat surfaces due to the camera bump.Overall an amazing and allrounder phone from OnePlus. Just close your eyes and buy if u want a premium device in mid range price.P.S. Purchased thru Amazon prime and got SBI disc of 2000.

246,5.0 ,"  I read a lot review about this phone, and decided to buy this and bought it within10 minutes post launch. And my expectations were so high and it's been a week since got the phone, did this phone fulfill all my expectations? Let's discuss it in the pros and cons section.Pros:1. Oxygen OS - fluidic UI experience, the widgets are really precise and upto the point.2. Camera - super macro is not just a specification on paper it really makes wonder. Primary camera and front camera are both best in class.3. Snapdragon 855+ - Multitasking don't worry, gaming don't worry, WebEx meetings don't worry this guy can handle everything. Lightening fast processor.4. 90hz refresh rate - the fluidic display is another feature that's not merely on paper. Can feel the smoothness in the display. And hdr videos are a bliss to watch in 90hz5. Design - the design of the phone is premium I personally liked the circular camera socket. It makes the phone look like a beast.6. Complementary pouch: the silicon pouch provided with the phone is best in quality and it enhances the look of the phone, friosted silver looks well on the transparent cover.Cons:Battery: it comes with 3800 mAh on regular usuage the battery last only a day and 5-9 hours, can't one plus come with 5000 mAh battery?Fingerprint scanner: I feel the finger print scanner is not the fastest. However the face unlock is lightening fast almost no delay.Overall: OnePlus is known for providing best user experience and it has taken miles ahead with the launch of OnePlus 7T. Despite the fact that OnePlus 7 is not real value for money, it compensated the users expectations with 7T. 7T I would say best flagship phone with 855+ processor.Go for it guys.

"
247,4.0 ,"  I am writing this review after almost using this product for a month.Camera and processor everything is nice.But I have been facing two issue - BATTERY DRAINAGE and HEATING.1. I have to charge it twice in 24hour. This is when I keep my brightness to almost minimum, usage is only for 4g and listening music via non-Bluetooth earphones.In case I connect to Bluetooth Earphones then battery drainage is even quicker (so I avoid it)2. During video calling, I noticed that phone starts heating heavily.I avoid using the phone while charging because I noticed heavy heating issue then as well (which I completely understand)

"
248,5.0 ,"  The best in class premium smartphone. Display and performance awesome to the core. Wrap charge 30T is more than enough, it will charge your phone upto 90% in 30 mins. Triple camera gives excellent images and does it's job even in low light condition. In-display fingerprint scanner, is perfect and is faster as like physical scanner. I was a OnePlus 3 user after that I used other brands as well and finally back to OnePlus again. Except battery everything is top notch. This can be improved in upcoming software updates. No more second thought to book this phone.

"
249,1.0 ,"  The device doesn't get switched on till 24hrs., The device got extremely heated up as it was going to explode. Want product replacement right away, this is very disappointing from 1+CUSTOMER SERVICE WON'T EVEN RESPOND FOR HALF AND HOUR OR MORE

"
250,5.0 ,"  Worth every penny. Trust me it's enough for anyone out there, many try to buy OnePlus 8 or 8 pro, but you won't need that at the end it's just a mobile and you no need to spend like 55k on a mobile. U can assure you that this device is nothing less than a pro version.  You get a powerful chip and a powerful software to hardware integration just like Apple. You get everything .  And coming to the heat issue I did not found any on my device.  Everything is so perfect. If you are thinking to buy, just go for it.  Trust me when you have this device in your hands you will feel the same like me

"
251,5.0 ,"  First day of using the 7T. Though most of the features were available with other flagship phones and at a much cheaper price I went ahead with Oneplus thanks to my flawless experience with OP5 for 2.5 years.Coming to the performance of the phone, the standout aspect would be the 90Hz refresh rate. The phone just seems to run so much smoother than its competitors. Other aspects would be the camera (obviously), dash charging(which definitely improved over Oneplus 5 and the aspect ratio of the screen which is just perfect. I feel the phone is heavier than the previous one I have used but this is not an issue at all.Will update after a few weeks as I explore the phone more as it is still too early to give a definitive review of the phone. So far, I'm loving the phone and I believe Oneplus has delivered yet again.

"
252,4.0 ,"  My second OnePlus device (the first one was the OnePlus TVbwhich was a big letdown!). The battery life of the phone is quite good and gives me 2 whole days on my use (4G is always on, bluetooth rarely, extensive calls, not much video). Also, even with the battery saver on, the performance of the display is very smooth (60Hz refresh rate and not 90Hz though that is available too). Since there is no 3.5mm headphone jack, music quality with USB earphones or even bluetooth ones suffers a bit (not an issue with the phone but just that accessories don't make the cut). Fingerprint reader is a big dud and one has to press many times at times for it to unlock. Not much of a camera buff and hence can't really comment on that. The few pictures that I took did come out well

"
253,5.0 ,"  My two primary drivers before this was the Poco f1 and the Nokia 7plus. So my comparision will primarily be with these two.Performance: One word - snappy !Display: Gorgeous. 90hz refresh rate is clearly noticeable.Battery: Now this is the most criticised aspect of the phone , well let me tell u it is NOT Bad at all ! Believe it or not I got 5+ hrs screen on time with 38% remaining , yes u read that right ! Can't believe it ?! Lol i have screenshot of the battery usage , see it for yourself. So technically I could have easily churned out 8hrs or more screen on time if i had used it till 5% battery. What is confusing is almost every reviewer on YouTube or even user reviews have quoted a maximum of 5.5 hrs SOT at max. Now let me share some tips which i feel might helped in my case , when i first setup my phone i was to migrate my data n apps from old phone. But i did not copy the nearly 100apps i had in my nokia 7 plus , instead i just copied the contacts and messages n synced other settings with Google account. I then clean installed all the apps that i use on a regular basis i.e some 20 odd apps. I am not sure but i feel this could have helped in improving the battery life. I always keep my location off n 4g data always on + wifi when available.Camera: Now most people compare this phone n it's camera with Apple , Google , samsung flagships but fail to understand that those phones cost almost double that of this phone ! The camera takes brilliant pics in good light , low light any lighting condition u throw at it. This camera is a lot good when viewed in isolation n it is only a lil bit inferior when compared side by side with iphone 11 or pixel 3/4 , also u get wide angle camera which is missing on pixel. The camera is more than good enough for social media uploads.Conclusion: Best phone overall n VFM by a mile. If u game a lot then get ROG 2 because that has a bigger battery but as an everyday driver for normal usage this is best !

258,5.0 ,"  I have been using Oneplus 7T for a month. I am just providing some general feedback on what I experienced. I'll write both pros and cons for your reference.Pros:1. 90FPS ( you can feel it for sure)2. Fluid AMOLED display3. A pretty good camera (you can compare it with Samsung 10 series)4. Price5. Latest processor6. OS and security updatesCons:1. Battery - With a 90fps display, the camera isn't that great. However, it will last a day and also gives you an option to choose 60fps to save some battery juice.2. Hugh camera bump - you should avoid this phone if you prefer to use this phone with no case cover3. Slippery (not a con, since most of the phones are slippery)You can go for it as this is the 3rd best android device in the market now next to Asus ROG 2 and OnePlus 7T Pro. You will definitely find this phone worth your month for sure.

"
259,4.0 ,"  I brought my OnePlus 7T on June 14-2020, just after using three days I'm giving 3 day review. As of now the device performance is pretty 👌😎👌 smooth with no lag or issues. Everything is working perfectly except the keyboard empty bar at bottom.Device Comes with 6.5 inch .. so people with small hands feel uncomfortable at their starting days.Camera is good at this price point i.e., shots are very good clarity.Coming to gaming it handles pubg with high graphics by default and runs without lag or framedrops thanks to Snapdragon 855+ and adreno 640 GPU. If you put your graphics at extreme and ultra level you will feel little warm but not that much.Coming to battery, it has 3800 maH battery which can easily lasts one day if you are normal user, if played games continuously it gives 4-5 hours of gaming time. If you are a heavy user with playing games and watching online content it last upto evening with screen on time 6 - 7 hours in my opinion.It has 90 Hz display .. so battery drains more compared to 60Hz ..but it is very less difference.This device Comes with beast 30watt charger so don't think about low battery notifications as you can charge it 100 percent in around one hour. Phone heats up slightly while charging, which is negligible.What I like in 7T:I personally like this round camera design, build qualityOxygen OS, no bloatware ..smooth performance.Display was superb.Very good cameras at this price.What I didn't like:Missed 3.5 mm audio jack.🔋 battery should have been given more as its display Comes with 90Hz refresh rate which drains battery. But ok because we have that 30 watt WRAP charging.This is my 3 day usage review of OnePlus 7T.. I will  update this in coming days.

"
260,4.0 ,"  This phone comes with a super cool camera which never disappoints with great display and dual speaker.Super smooth performance great gaming experience.Only thing which disappoints a little is battery.It gives a day full of moderate use in one full charge which takes around an hour with Wrap Charge 30T.Ratings out of 10:Camera:9Performance:9Display:10Speakers:8Gaming:9Connectivity:8Charging Speed:9Battery:7Overall User Experience:9

"
261,5.0 ,"  The good: lightning-fast phone. Oxegen OS is brilliant, everything you need and no bloatware. The screen is big, very clear, and ultra-smooth due to the fast refresh rate. Not rated as waterproof but it can take a dunk and keep going. Looks amazing, very good build quality. Warp charge is the best fast charging tech out there. 0% to 80% takes about 15minutes.The bad: no wireless charging. Pictures are a bit too crisp making things look a bit surreal. The in-screen fingerprint scanner is not as fast or as accurate as of the dedicated scanners from the last generation. But once that happens, the phone is very good and fast. Even wearing a hoodie with sunglasses it will pick me up.Overall I would recommend this phone for people who watch a lot of videos, play a lot of games, or run multiple apps often. Not for people who take a lot of selfies or care about having the absolute best camera on the market.

"
262,2.0 ,"  This is my week 3 with this phone. Buy it if you are willing to make many compromises. Some of the basic functions like copy contact to existing contact does not work. Software was given 10/10 in some of the reviews. You can clearly see that is sponsored. Voice is so muffled. Lot of times no clarity or sharpness. Finds it so hard to establish a connection with network. Call drop is so frequent that you will be sure why the networks have become so poor. I had for a short time bought Oppo A83. That phone leaving camera was much better than this phone with its Mediatek processor. Rs.37,999 is a complete waste. Horrible Phone !!! Don't fall for the hype by all the reviewers !! You can 2 good phones for the price. Oxygen OS has no Oxygen in it !!

263,4.0 ,"  I am a One Plus fan. BUT When I initially bought the One Plus 7T I was appalled by the battery life and the phone heating. I made a complaint to the One Plus customer care. The next day itself I received an update. Since then the phone is not heating up and the battery life has become significantly better. STILL SCOPE FOR IMPROVEMENT HEREThe finger print reader and the camera could be better but acceptable.Overall I am happy now but not as thrilled as I was with their earlier phones.One plus customer care number is 18001028411The more number of callers the better chance of improvement.

Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%. am among the first to buy this phone without prime membership.Posting this review after 4 weeks of using the phone. I can't compare it with other flagships as this is my first one in this range. I loved the 90Hz display and the fingerprint reader is also quite good.There is no lagging issue till now.The battery backup is good but not excellent with such a higher frame rate but man the charging speed is much more than wonderful. I was totally amazed at first.Camera quality is good but the colour sensing needs some improvements. It's a bit warm and not natural as you can see in the photos provided,one without adjustment and the other one with warmth reduced a bit.Speakers are loud and produce decent sound.

271,5.0 ,"  Pros+Never before Seen Buttery smooth - Amazing display.Good Camera setup with triple cameras that are actually useful.Great battery life. 6 to 7 hours of screen time.Decently Fast warp ChargingGreat Speakers. Good loudness and also a little bit of bass. Great detail.Build Quality. Amazing. If i could only wish to run it without a case. Feels amazing in the hand.Cons-Charging could have been faster (but it is faster than majority of the phones) considering this takes around 50mins whilst the Realme does it in 30mins and it costs cheaper.Camera bump maybe prone to scratches. Noticed a tiny scratch on the circular lens.No heaphone jack. Cant plug in headphones. And any bluetooth headphones are still ways to catch up to the wired headphones. I miss the headphone jack.A big phone. Difficult, but not impossible to maneuver in one hand.Detailed consensus: ~The Display is amazing. Seriously. 90hz. I wasnt as impressed at the beginning as i expected to be. But in month's period ..just looking at my mom's OnePlus 7 screen feels sluggish. Any other conventional display seems outdated and that's where i realised the brilliance of this tech. It just works to provide the best experience without you even noticing. I became really fast at responding with the touch. Gaming didn't work upto 90hz atleast to my experience with pubg but it is great as it is at 60fps. Camera is also good. Wide angle shots are the best when u need to get one giant family in a picture. Portrait shots look like professional dslr shots to post on the social media. Nightscape works decent for this segment. There are some caveats being the white balance, which seemes to be inconsistent among the three cameras under harsh lighting conditions (probably can be imporved in software updates). Battery life is excellent IMHO. 6 to 7 hours easily with moderate usage. Even if u game hours on the end, you should atleast get around atleast 5 and half hours of screen time. There are, however, very small but few bugs. The quick launch from fingerprint keeps deselecting the contacts i selected. The gallery seems to have some problem sometimes sending media through whatsapp. There are a few bugs but to my all honesty Apple's IOS right now has a lot more than that. And when it comes to the software, this OS is the best fork of android and spending a couple of grand more is justifiably worth it. Once you use it, the ingenuity cannot go unnoticed and makes everything simpler. Overall great phone and if you are planning to use it for a long time then you shouldn't have to think twice.

I don't know why no one is talking about this. Either everyone out there is filthy rich or just out of there mind. Idk. OP need to understand because m sure due to this they really gonna lose there market. Although there is no fault of this phone(OP7t). This phone is best rn in it's league. Go for it.

Coming to the camera, it's defnitely more versatile then the OnePlus 7 but it's still not great. Battery life is just decent but the fast charging more than makes up for it. Plug in for about 30-45 mins and you are good for the day. Definitely worth the price.The only thing to be wary about is the huge camera bump at the back, the outer glass is not scratch resistant as confirmed by the OnePlus customer care executive.

The build quality is solid but it definitely needs a case as the back glass is fragile.The display is just way too good for this phone . 1000 nits of brightness is just too much .The battery lasts almost for a day with moderate usage but if gaming is done , the phones needs to get charged 2 times the day . This is not a huge problem as the 30 watt is insanely fast af .Stereo speakers are very loud too and the oxygen OS is the best os of android.Gaming is just too smooth but if played for more than 2 hours at a stretch , it heats a little bit (around 41°c-42°c ) .I really miss the headphone jack in this device . Alteast they could have provided a adapter but unfortunately it isn't there .Overall its an extremely valuable for money device . Comparing it to iqoo and realme , its wayy better than x2 pro except fot the charging but for iqoo , i personally dont like the os.  Also it's a new brand and we don't know how reliable it is.  How would be the updates etc . Also iqoo comes with the same os offered in vivo smartphone which is absolutely shit.Samsung s10 lite (128+8) variant is out of stock and (512+8) is for 50k which i feel is just wayy to overpriced .Conclusion:-If os is not a deal breaker then iqoo is better then one plus 7t .Don't but realme x2 pro . Camera is pathetic . Also the os isn't that great .

278,1.0 ,"  I have bought One plus 7T mobile 3 months before. While I was working in offline suddenly the mobile got switched off and showing that the device got corrupt. I have visited nearby oneplus service center in Coimbatore. They told that the data got erased and need to install the software for further use. But after attempting to install the software, the hardware didnt accept the installation. They said to change the motherboard worth Rs.21000/- See the worth of the mobile is Rs.38000/-. What is the use in using this repaired mobile. Very worst experience I faced using the One plus mobile. Dont purchase Oneplus mobile. Very poor technical service in One plus.

"
279,5.0 ,"  The phone is just perfect. Flagship grade. Minus the headphone jack, IP rating and a bit heavy, else everything thing is great and it turns out be a great package. Software is bloat free. UI (oxygenOS) is quiet stock like but with its own set of customisation. The colour, Glacier Blue looks stunning in the matt finish with its own incorporation of gradient colour shift. Has a big camera bump but is livable with coz it comes with a case that's grips it's firmly. Though the colours are a bit saturated at times but the over all image quality is beautiful, well detailed and pleasing. Night mode is another area where it does quit well but not as perfect as other flagships. The fingerprint reader is optical type and is the fastest of its type when compared to other optical ones out there. Face unlock is 2D based but really fast and unlocks in a blink. The battery a big 3800 mah is just great to get you through a day with mild usage but does take a hit while heavy usage such as gaming, but non the less it ships with 30 watt Warp Charger that charges it in 50 mins to almost full. Need to mention that it doesn't ship with a headphone nor with a type C to 3.5 mm jack converter which I feel should have been a standard given the premium price one is paying for it.

I upgraded from OP5T due to the bargain price on offer but have mixed feelings for phone. Over all its a good phone. Here goes my thoughts on it at length 😀.It feels bigger, taller and heavier in hand compared to 5T. Sincerely wish someone starts making flagship phone in smaller form factor again.Have screen guard and a rugged case in the box which is a plus.3.5 mm doesn't come with it so have to order one. I'm not a fan of bluetooth headset as it's one more thing that I have to remind myself to charge.OP launcher is feature rich so I haven't gone back to my Nova prime yet.Tried to backup and restore with OP switch with mixed results.. didn't restore my apps 1st time but asked to restore again while I was midway through reinstalling my apps.Camera is good but will take getting used to. Does not allow choosing the megapixel size explicitly any longer.Overall it has been a step up in terms of specs but have mixed feelings comparing it to my OP5t

282,5.0 ,"  If you are looking for a phone that has great display, fast charging, great camera and smooth performance, OnePlus 7t is the phone to go after.OnePlus has been always offering great at display, fast charging, and great smooth performance. With the launch of OnePlus 7t, they have really improved the camera quality. The triple camera setup certainly helps to capture great photos. Truly impressed with the portraits, ultra wide mode, and nightscape modes.If you ignore the back camera bump with circular setup, this is fantastic phone. Strongly recommend it.

283,4.0 ,"  I am not sure whether Amazon's partnership with SBI YONO is a scam. I have purchased OnePlus 7T from Amazon's API within SBI YONO mobile application.As per the offer I should have got Rs. 2500 cashback as Amazon Pay balance in my account.It has been more than 3 months and I got nothing.Amazon's customer care is blaming SBI YONO and there is no option I have found to reach SBI YONO customer support for shoppingIn my opinion, if you are buying something from Amazon then, don't belive in cashback offers.Amazon and SBI YONO togather seems like a scam.

284,5.0 ,"  OnePlus 7T is an excellent device and different from OnePlus 7 and could have been named as 8 instead of 7T.But THIS CANNOT BEAT OnePlus 7 Pro. Read below the Pros, mids, cons, and verdict.PROS (POSITIVES):1) Design: OnePlus 7 was not at all looking premium. But this time, the 7T is a mastered design piece. Earlier the camera bump was very ugly. Now it looks very beautiful due to its circular placement. And it looks very premium due to matte-finish and well suited for all kinds of people.2) Weight & thickness: The device doesn't feel heavy at all due to balanced weight management and it is very easy to handle due to slim 8.1 mm thickness.3) Processor: This device hosts the world's fastest processor - Snapdragon 855+ chipset processor. So everything is butter-smooth. This has been always their flagship area.4) UI: There is no smartphone user interface as simple and as powerful as on OnePlus devices. Oxygen UI is always the king of all other UIs.5) Battery: Optimised in latest Oxygen and latest Android 10, provides very nice battery backup.6) Sound: Along with the loudness, there is Dolby Atmos 360 degree revolving sound effect. This is really excellent. Clarity is amazing.7) RAM: RAM management is always good on OnePlus devices and one need not worry how the Oxygen OS handles the RAM. And even base variant comes in 8 GB this time.8) Dash Charger: OnePlus' master technology which is there from past so many years, continues to be still the world's best technology in the chargers segment. No other brand can provide this kind of advanced and fastest charger.9) Alert Slider: Alert slider is very, very smooth from 7 series. One loves to use the alert slider even when not necessary.10) Fingerprint sensor: The world's fastest in-display fingerprint scanner I can say.11) Brightness: OnePlus 7T has more brightness compared to 7. Excellent.12) Vibration Motor: As OnePlus promised from 7 series, the vibration motor will be 200% strong, we can really feel that. There is no rattling sound even when it was tested on the highest intensity. And the haptic feedback is really amazing to feel.13) Storage: Thanks to UFS 3.0 storage technology for faster data transfers.14) Screen Guard: Last time a few users complained that the applied screen guard had some bubbles, specks of dust, misplacements, etc. But this time, I think they have taken special care and it is excellently applied without any issues.15) Camera: Though camera quality is good on OnePlus devices, they provide a very simple interface with no features at all.MIDS (NEUTRAL):1) Display: I have multiple OnePlus devices in my family. OnePlus 7T's display's color calibration is not good WHEN COMPARED TO OnePlus 7 Pro or even OnePlus 5T. I am a little surprised about this. I tried to adjust the color calibration manually in so many ways, but I never got the colors like on 5T or 7 Pro. I feel the red or magenta is lacking in the device. I think, this they may fix through updates. But however, please note that this cannot be identified by everyone. Since I work in the multimedia segment, I can easily catch the differences. Hence I am putting the display, not in CONS, but MIDS, considering average or neutral.2) Case: The provided TPU case is very nice and looks like it gives strong protection even if it falls. But the case is glossy/shiny. When the device is matte, what is the use of a glossy case?3) No Pop-up Selfie Camera: If this is provided, the device's thickness increases. If not provided, no 100% display. I personally prefer the device's thickness rather than a popup. This is left to individuals and hence I have categorized this in this Mids section.CONS (NEGATIVES):1) Navigation Gestures: I am very much surprised to see that OnePlus have REMOVED an option to go back to the previous screen by swiping bottom right to the top. One can go back to the previous screen only by swiping right to left or left to right (just like on MI devices) and not bottom right to top like earlier. I think they will add this feature in the coming updates. Because I guess this is the default feature of the new Android 10.2) Color Options: I don't know the plans of OnePlus when it comes to colors. Their color schemes and releases are always frustrating. Now they have released two colors: blue and silver. But silver is not available in the 256 GB variant. This is frustrating. And after a few days, to frustrate the old buyers, they will release one more beautiful color, just like they did for OnePlus 7 (by releasing mirror blue) or for OnePlus 7 Pro (Almond White). So the one who buys, in the beginning, is frustrated. And even the one who buys later is also frustrated, because again in just a few months, the next version of OnePlus gets released. I think there should be some intelligent strategies by OnePlus regarding these things. Just like Samsung and Apple, they manufacture the old devices even after years. Samsung's S8/S9 is still current. J7 is still current. Apple's very old iPhones are current.VERDICT:Due to its many pros, I really like to rate the device 5 stars. But this is definitely NOT an upgrade or replacement to OnePlus 7 Pro. OnePlus 7 Pro is very premium having curved edges, QHD display with excellent color calibrations. But this is definitely a complete upgrade for OnePlus 7 users. I recommend this to everyone. Don't ever think to buy K20 or other 855+ chipset devices thinking that they are cheaper compared to this. No. OnePlus cannot be compared to other brands. Blindly go for this.

"
285,4.0 ,"  The phone is awsome and is very fast. And is in no way expensive compared to the quality of and the features provided.But I don't like the Colors. And if I am paying 38k for a product I atleast expect some good Colors. Atleast give a basic black option.And I am removing 1 star because of no type C headphones provided with the phone and ofcourse the bad color options. Instead of the ugly phone case provided with the phone I would rather prefer a cheap type C headphones.

Iam posting this review after one day usage of one plus 7t..Camera is awesomeBattery life is awesomeAmoled display with 90hz refresh ratio is mind blowingOxygen os is just killed...

"
288,3.0 ,"  I had Oneplus 6 before this and that phone was very good and it made me fan of oneplus. So after using OP6 for 18 months I decided to buy OP7T and it came , but slowly day by day this product is going below my expectations. The only thing I am satisfied in this is Camera. Rest performance is not as expected from Oneplus. The fingerprint does not work that fast. Lags alot and Hangs alot mostly when I get whatsapp calls and phone is locked. Lightroom app works very slowly conpared to my previous OP6. Feel is good battery backup is decent but performance wise am little worried about how long this phone will last.

"
289,4.0 ,"  Reviewing this phone after 3 months of usage.Pros--camera quality is superb-warp charging is a boon for me, after full battery gets drained it charges up fully in 30 mins. Can u believe it? It works consistently.-with battery saver turned on battery comes for 2 days with basic usage (calls, WhatsApp, browsing)-speaker audio quality is goodCons--i couldn't realize how the 90 hz refresh rate improves speed and performance. I couldn't find any difference from an MI phone's.-only USB c port for earphone. So have to buy a Bluetooth earphone or the unreliable c port connectors.-double tap to wake up the screen is not working for me-not for people who handles their phones carelessly/rough handles

290,5.0 ,"  I have to replace my current Pixel phone as it had become too sluggish. I loved Pixel's camera and was planning to buy Pixel 4 but alas it didn't launch in India. So I wanted to check for other phones and decided to reduce the budget of the phone. I wanted a decent camera, UI close to stock android and a good camera. I have used OnePlus2 before so I decided to go for the latest OnePlus 7t and its a fabulous Phone for this price range.PROS- Awesome camera (not pixel but very good)- The battery lasts longer and warp charge is super fast- The display is very good- Build is niceCONS- Not a big fan of the camera bump and setup but it's subjective (maybe someone may like it)- The display is not end-to-end like 7Pro and 7T Pro but not enough. 7t pro is definitely looking gorgeous but almost 14k more expensive.Also got it in Diwali offer so the deal was good.

"
291,5.0 ,"  This time one plus has nailed it with more snappier and more smoothing experience mobile ever been manufactured. Using it since a week and it is a breeze to switch between apps. RAM management has improved drastically than before. Camera is decent but provides you with the better quality than other 48 mp equipped phones currently available. Gaming mode is the best as I play alot of games most heaviest of all till now is cod mobile which runs buttery smooth and gives you pc like graphics and frames.Best buy and recommended for gamers.

"
292,4.0 ,"  Battery charging is really fast..But again u have only 3800 mah battery.Sound quality is far way better .There was much hype about camera, and i bought the phone due to that purpose only and sadly it doesnot come par expectation.Black, blue surface and camera looks nice and different.Navigation tools are working fine.You will feel the void of 3.5mm jack.

"
293,1.0 ,"  There is big display tint problem in most off the 7T modelsAnd nothing is reply by officials of OnePlus support team. They always said that this is common in 90 Hertz fluid amoled display. This is not called a problem. I have visited the service center and they also replied me same. Now I tried to purchase OnePlus 8 series in exchange of 7T but 7T is not in the list to exchange. So now I am confirming that the 7T series is faulty one and they have not a solution about it. So don't buy this model. Go for other options.

"
294,4.0 ,"  I bought OnePluse first time and i am very happy with its performance, camara quality, and other things, the only problem is battery life it drains very fast if i am playing games or watching the video it's it gose 100 to 40 % in just 2.5 hrs .  If i am using it only music and chating it gose 100 to 50 in abut 5-6 hrs with out any heavy use. I compared battery like with OnePluse 6t at 90%  6t was giving 21hrs of life and my OnePluse 7t was giving 13 hrs of life.About face unlock system i thik there is some problem with it . Even by brother can open my phone and we are not twins. Other then that it's the one of the best phone i ever used.

"
295,3.0 ,"  Sold the phone in within 10 days of usage bcos of some unacceptable issues1 The vibration of this phone is too light that you can't feel that into your pocket when someone calls you2 The main reason of selling this phone is that when you're on the call and the third person calls you bt u can't get notified that  the third person is calling you while at that time my call waiting was also activated..Besides these two reasons phone is decently good at this price point as it can't compete with Samsung bcos Samsung's screen quality the speaker quality is way better than oneplus..

297,5.0 ,"  I am using this product from last 5 months now. A good upgrade from my previous one, 3T. I will list down the pros and cons for your better understanding.Pros-1. CHARGING- the fast 30W charger is absolutely amazing. Charges the phone from 0 to 100 just inside an hour. 30 mins charge enough to give power for d entire day.2. PERFORMANCE- 8GB RAM + 855+ Snapdragon is a lethal combination 🔥 fluid & perfect in every sense. Never faced any lagginess in day to day use.3. DISPLAY- the fluid AMOLED 90Hz display is outstanding. Gives hard times going back to 60Hz displays.4. STERIO SPEAKER- the dual Dolby Atmos speakers are louder, clearer & better than ever. The music comes out equivalent to that of mid ranged bluetooth speakers. The bass is also fantastic.5. CAMERA- the triple camera set up for 48+12+16mp does the job amazing. The best part is macro shots.6. OS- OnePlus's biggest strength is its Oxygen OS. Better than stock android in all sense.Cons-1. NO 3.5mm Headphone Jack2. 3800mAh battery is just average. Will give you backup whole day if you use moderately.3. The phone is fragile because of its glass back and needs to be kept in a protective case 24*74. My phone had an issue initially while rebooting which was however gone after an update.My final conclusion- GO FOR IT!! IT'S WORTH EVERY PENNY.

"

Best display2.best speakers for this price3.rear camera is awesome4. Best haptics5.good mobile connection6. Best operating system7. Top chip processor(SD-855+)8. Best night mode shotCons.1.

302,5.0 ,"  If you have one plus 6 or 7 do not upgraded to this there are no major changes in any form camera or anything. Before this I had one plus 6 recently I lost that phone so bought this one and Im not found  any major difference.

In battery it last more than one day for normal use for heavy use one day.

304,3.0 ,"  Using it since last one month.. product quality is not upto the mark, its hang a lot, some time its camera freezed and feel helpless, OS is superb... blue colour look very good. Battery life is average will long last till 10-12 hours only with screen time of about 4 hrs  without gaming but its charge very fast.. screen showing pink tint when u see it from side. Camera is good. Got Warp 30 adaptor in the box instead of warp 30T but as per Amazon its Warp 30T technology is in the phone hence charger is warp 30 only. Phone some time stuck which is surpise to me may be some software update will resolve the issue. Placement of volume button is not correct as accendently it captures the screenshots. Seems its bit overpriced and should be priced at about 32K with better battery life. If you are comparing it with Note 9 than will advise to go for Note 9.

"
305,5.0 ,"  I've been planning to switch from iPhone to OnePlus phones for long and the launch of new OnePlus 7T seemed like the perfect opportunity. Everything I love about Android - and more comes in a all in one package with this phone along with the latest and best in class hardware. Be it unlocking the phone in a snap or accessibility of using productivity or social media apps, or running heavy games like Fortnite and Call of Duty - this phone is a beast. I would highly recommend everyone to go for it, especially Apple users who are planning to switch

WARP charge is the best available right now in the market but battery drains rapidly. It seems price is little bit more compared to when Oneplus started.

The charging is better than I ever imagined. 40 mins in the morning and I'm good to go for the rest of the day!The fingerprint and face unlock works great.

319,5.0 ,"  Review after ine week of usuage:-Design: The design is gorgeous with glacier blue colour having a gradient finish on the back. The camera module is somewhat a personal prefercence but in 2019 with all phones looking exactly same from back side it does give it a different look. Personally i really like the camera island type design.Screen: The screen is full hd amoled 90hz refresh rate screen. Its again gorgesous to look at,media content looks amazing,and once u start using 90hz refresh rate its dificult to go back to normal 60hz refresh rate. Its something which can be experience d and cant be explained.Camera : The triple camera set up does the job, the main sensor is 48mp sensor which takes great shots in daylight/natural light, ultrawide lens is great for taking wider view and is a superb addition to main camera. Portrait shots have good depth and does a good job at separating object with the background. The best feature has to be the macro mode,it takes some great macro shots ,with subject as close as two inches, all the food bloggers will love this feature .Performance: Fast, performance is just fast ,u throw anything at it it just doesnt lag, multitasking is butter smooth.Battery : battery is decent ,gets almost one full day around 15-17hrs at heavy usuage. But charging is super fast,plug in and u get 0-70 in almost half hour.Over all at this price point ,this phone has top notch specs,and delivers the performace thats expected out of it.Only Asus Rog phone 2 is near and in some cases better than this phone at this orice,but dats a game centric phone and may be not everyones cup of tea.Last words: If u are in market for a new one,under 40k price bracket and want all the flagship features ,great performace and software experience and all round performibg camera...Do go for this phone !!!!

322,5.0 ,"  Very powerful and great display.Camera is typical OnePlus where they tend to do some overprocessing, especially colour reproduction and edge sharpness. Edges of any object are not sharp, slight oil paint effect and oversaturated colours in bright light. Software update should fix it. Portrait mode gives a very great blurred background.Battery life is good with moderate use you can get through one full day. Switch off the 90Hz and you are comfortable for the day.Adaptive brightness is flawed right now but it will be fixed by bug fix i am assuming.Oxygen OS, as always is great. Dolby Atmos sound is great.Very few things to point at and many things pointing out!!Only complaint, no frosted silver in 256 gb

323,5.0 ,"  OnePlus was my dream since OnePlus 5 and finally i purchased OnePlus 7T. Believe me it's great. You will never regret buying this as it's super fast with great capable cameras and Stereo speakers are fantastic. I would recommend you to go for frosted silver as the company is also promoting Glacier blue more and that's why everyone is taking blue but Frosted silver is far far better. Blue  looks like funky but you a decent colour then go for Silver and Black Sandstone OnePlus Protective cases looks great with frosted silver guys. Trust me.2 more things...There are many negative reviews regarding Amazon so before purchasing i myself contacted customer care and they assured me that in case of any problem..my phone will be replaced. But i didn't faced any problem. Just check the box if it is sealed otherwise ask a replacement.Many people are facing an issue including me  of "" Turn on the wifi to finish the setup""Today i got rod of this by simply turning on the wifi, closing the mobile data and then.. clicking on start and following the procedures. Don't go for deleting the cache memory and all.

"
325,4.0 ,"  I'm more of a laptop person, but wanted a good phone and i think i got it. This review is after usage of 15 days.So, this one's going to be in different points:1.) Display: 90 Hz is really good if you spend a lot of your time in your phone. If you keep on 90 Hz you will get even less than average battery life. I recommend turning on 90 Hz only when you are doing something which needs great display quality.2.) Battery: It's the only con i could find in this great phone. BUT,BUT,BUT, the charger makes up around 90% of this less battery life issue. You can get full charge from 0 in at max 70 minutes. To summarize, you can go for it if you have a desk job.3.) Performance: It's pretty fast. As fast as any reasonable person would need. Truth is this is a 35k phone, so the performance you get is definitely worth 50k. Don't compare it with phones which are above 80k or 90k. If you do that, you're just a badgering person.4.) Camera: Not really a camera freak, but it's really good. You get all the details you want and expect from a cell phone. IF YOU ARE A SELF-CERTIFIED CAMERA ENTHUSIAST, BUY A DSLR. Nobody's stopping you from that. Don't hope a phone will give you the world's best camera.I wish i could give 4.5 stars but since Amazon only supports a Floor Function or a Ceiling Function when it comes to rating, could only give a 4.

326,4.0 ,"  This phone is like aThis is not the most premium phone on the market. Its not as good to hold as an iphone 11 or have the fantastic camera like the Samsung flagships. What it is though is the snappiest no-nonsense phone on the market.Oxygen OS contributes a lot to this. Everthing on the phone is lightning quick and snappy. Apps open instantly, and the phone responds to everything you do like its nothing.The 90hz display will spoil you and every other phone display thats not 90hz will look like ageing technology.Battery life is okay.. In most cases it will last the entire day with medium use. That's hardly a problem though because 30 mins will give you full charge. The dash charging is something I cannot let go off which is why I refuse to buy more premium flagships.The triple camera and the camera software in general is not in line with what premium brands like samsung and apple offer, Oneplus isn't doing anything new here. The macro feature is however worth mentioning.If you are having trouble deciding if this phone is for you let me break it down :1. Camera & Photos is priority - Get Samsung/Apple instead2. Speed is priority - Get OnePlus3. Fast charging is priority - Get OnePlus4. Budget is a concern - Get OnePlus5. Color accuracy is a priority - Get Samsung6. Apple EcoSystem is a concern - Get Iphone

330,5.0 ,"  I bought this device for better gaming experience. And I'm honestly happy with it. Playing HDR/Extreme PUBG is really cool, except for battery consumption, but it is expected because of the 3900Mah battery. So i changed to smooth/extreme which is not bad at all.I don't care about the camera anyway.Battery life, as mentioned above, is not much good when you're gaming , Otherwise its fine even with 90Hz refresh rate.Should have came up with a better battery, but it may be impossible anyway.Fast charging is really cool. Pretty much quick charging.Once you buy a 1+, you 'll feel the satisfaction.

337,5.0 ,"  **Will upload photos soon**Ordered this on 28th September and had it delivered a day ahead today. I'm simply mesmerized to be honest with device's overall performance. Please don't go by the YouTube review about the box and its contents cause on reality, you get just the phone packed in its box. No earphones are included in the purchase although it was mentioned in the description while buying it.Pros:1) Stunning camera and it does delivers awesome quality. I'll upload some shots soon. The slow vid and 4k 60fps are two major plus signs. The wide and the ultrawide shots are amazing along with the macro which I'm yet to explore more.2) The screen!! It's super smooth and navigation is simply effortless. The typing response is best I've ever experienced and so is the color balance that you can set as per your preference.3) The weight and build quality is premium and defines the phone as a flagship buster. I ordered the blue one and it's quite an effect on itself.4) Silicone case is included and a thin screen protector film is already applied. The case is not a usual cheap stuff but good one.5) Dolby Atmos. Now, I've been using Dolby Atmos for more than 3 years and can tell you that it's a must for people deeply rooted into music.Cons: Device has no cons in terms of looks, performance or build quality however, I expected a bit louder speaker output. The phone without the cover is quite slippery and can easily fall off so I'm being extra careful with my new baby.Overall, this did satisfy my expectations to a great limits considering the fact that I was never an OnePlus guys. This is my first.

339,5.0 ,"  This is my first purchase from a costly phone range after using 10k budget phones.After a several months of use i found no issue until a month My phone wasn hang on bootlogo suddenly after usual battery drainage, gone to service center found no help rather than factory data reset and erase everything they say but I disagree to give my phone to them that day, as I had some imp data in there, so I took my phone back home and after charging it to full then I don't know how it came back to life again, then after that this problem was never happened again.About this phone I think this phone is way costly as its camera it not that top notch quality, Click good pictures under good source of light, but night vision is good like okish, portrait is also good but only from back cam setup(48 mp),Battery life is good when you use you don't use your phone that much, otherwise ok until you gaming, or using highly loading websites, specially when you play PUBG, the battery drains down quickly here. So this is a major drawback.When it comes about processing speed and visuals (90hz) it gives all its best.So if you want to buy it for faster multitasking or gaming its a good choice, but if you want to buy this phone for battery backup, camera quality, you can find something better than this

344,3.0 ,"  I wish i had other options. but unfortunately all these made in china phones are similar, be it Oppo, Vivi, Mi, Realme, Xiome etc etc. Motorola was a good brand but since Lenovo took it over it's quality has deteriorated.There is no headphone jack. you have to buy separately a C2 adopter and a headphone or go for wireless head phones.If you can afford then go for Apple (Though it is made in China but it is much better).

"
345,5.0 ,"  I have been using OnePlus devices since the launch of 3T and my entire experience has been seamless. OnePlus 7T is no exception as it easily surpasses a lot of other devices at the same price point and even gives a touch competition to some of the flagship phones out there including Samsung and Apple. The Ram management, large screen, in-display fingerprint scanner, camera and all other features need no mention as OnePlus has always focussed on delivering better. Should buy if you have a budget in that range.

346,1.0 ,"  My cell is switching  on and off on its own randomly. Once it switches off it goes into a continuous reboot mode. (Like a loop). I NEED to wait  till the battery  drains out for me to  actually  do something. I have no over choice. I have video proof  of the same. My cell is hardly 6 months old. Between January to June this has happened 6 times. I even contacted the One Plus service center who did a remote flash. Useless. The problem still persists. I was never expecting this from Amazon and One Plus.

"
347,4.0 ,"  The most concerning thing about this phone is the battery life.  The battery life could have been better, comparing the rivels.  The worst flagship phones that had weaker battery performance have resolved this issue, but I wonder why OnePlus did not see it as a concern. I have bought this 7T after having used Redmi Note 4 for 2 years; I have had premium smartphones in the past, such as iPhone 3Gs, 4, Samsung Note 3.I am totally happy with the performance with the only cons being an average battery life.  Redmi's battery was overwhelmingly good with a decent performance.I am using battery saver option during work so that I have enough juice left till I reach home. The Warp charger is a saviour.  With battery saver option, I am able to sail through the day to bedtime.The call quality, speaker and signal reception are good even at basements and underground metro stations.Oxygen OS is close to stock android and snappy most of the time.  Additionally, OnePlus is offering free extended warranty for 1 year for all its customers having models from OnePlus 6 onwards, which is a great marketing strategy.

348,4.0 ,"  After a month of use, these are the pros and cons I've had with the Oneplus 7T.PROS:-Insane charging speed.-90Hz ingenuity.-Blazing fast performance.-Bright screen.-Amazing macro mode shots.-Very fast face unlock.CONS (after one month use):-Though it is fast in charging, there are variations. The charging time during 85% of the cycles from 0-100 is around 50-55 minutes but at times it has taken me nearly 1 hour 10 minutes.-Though not regularly, it does heat up at times when there is heavy usage.-The phone feels heavy considering it only has a 3800 mAh battery.-The camera is great but may not seems impressive because by default the regular 'Photo' mode only produces 12 MP pics. And to make use of the 48 MP, you have regularly use the 'Pro' mode.-The haptics seem mediocre as the double tap to wake up/turn off the screen is noy always responsive.-1080p display. Though this may not be a dealbreaker for everyone, you gotta admit that watching videos or playing games on a better screen is just beautiful.-The auto brightness is not on the dot. It doesn't always detect properly. And when it does, it's too slow.-Not having wireless charging in 2019 🙄. Come on Oneplus!Apart from all of this, it still is an amazing phone to use and definitely recommendable to other. This is the technology world and nothing is perfect. Cheers ✌️

So it can run any android game on max. setting available. PUGB-m runs on HDR graphics with EXTREME FPS.3.Camera is really awesome you can take micro shots also. slow motion video supports upto 240 FPS .4.Face unlock works properly even in low light but fingerprint sensor is little bit slow (FOR ME BECAUSE as i am switched from physical sensor to optical sensor.)5.Battery life is not good as it discharge faster than other phone also it discharge even when it is not in use but charging is Super-Fast (WARP 30 T CHARGER).6.OXYGEN UI is good as it provides many utilities and gesture for faster commutation  but as  i am switched from MIUI so i don't like it too much but in oxygen UI their is no bloatware as compared to MIUI.7.So in the end it is premium looking flagship with beast specification.

351,5.0 ,"  The experience with the OnePlus 7T is simply smooth and flawless. OnePlus have realised the difference a 90Hz panel makes, which is why they are including it on all their products. And you have to use it to believe it, a screen with 90Hz refresh rate is truly a joy to use (undoubtedly my favourite part of the phone). Coming to battery life, it easily lasts a day and a half for my usage but my usage is not that heavy. I only have to plug it in for 40 mins every morning before I go to work, nothing else ( charging speeds are INSANE). Lastly, as a person who is coming from a phone that was in a much lower price segment, I find the cameras to be more than adequate. However, if you truly want that top of the line camera experience, you may have to look at other flagships. We also know how quick and reliable OnePlus are with software updates and that is yet another great positive with this device. All in all, for 38K, I feel like OnePlus hit the nail on the head with this one. The phone is so slick and a joy to use on a day to day basis and comes with more or less all the bells and whistles you need.P.S: OnePlus is now offering 2 years warranty for models released including and after the 6T. So I guess that's peace of mind assured as well!

"
352,3.0 ,"  Being a big Fan of One plus, this disappointed me alot when i changed it with One plus 5T to 7T.  The performance wise i doesnt feel much difference despite of having upgraded OS. Camera is way much better due to change in lens. The most disappointed thing in this phone is battery. I have to charge it minimum two times for a use of least 14 to 15 hours. Atleast they have to upgrade the software to be feasible with 3800 Mah battery. Looks are good having a circular lens on the side.

"
353,2.0 ,"  I ordered this phone on day 1 because I wanted to experience ""flagship"". Got this for 40k. So am using this phone for 4+ months.The first time I got hands on this phone, it didn't feel very classy. One shouldn't pay more than 23-25k for such a phone.Pros and cons mixed just as I think:1) Screen flickers! Irritatingly so. Certain games such as ""push 'em all"" is not supported as screen begins flickering. YouTube also causes screen to flicker most of the time. Not everyone may be able to notice it but it does flicker, you can search videos about it on YoutTube.2) OxygenOS has bugs with in-app Twitter browser, with its own Notes app and many others. I reported all within 2 days of buying the phone but forget fix, I didn't get a response either. These bugs were very irritating at first now I've somehow gotten used to those.3) Camera is better than most android phones I've seen but Pixel and iPhone 11 beat this one, hands down.4) Battery is average, lasts 24 hr. Good thing is the dash-charger - It's very impressive, charges in 60-65 mins from 0 to 100% and 0 to 70% in ~30 mins.5) Night mode, Reading mode are also impressive and I feel the difference when compared to other Android phones.6) Finger-print reader could have been better7) Face unlock doesn't work in dark or even dim light. Even in lightness, our face needs to be in proper angle and a lazy face doesn't help unlock.8) You need to buy a usb to 3.5mm jack cable separately.9) Flash could have been better.10) 8 GB RAM can be felt. It's fast. WiFi Calling, app installing, holding a network - all are very good.11) Video calling in dim light/darkness could have been better. Way better.12) Speakers are great. Ideal for music.13) The gestures part is good. Makes a lot of functions easier and classier.14) Haptic vibration is awesome.15) I like how it asks for permission for everything and gives plenty of options regarding access to apps and carrier.16) I use Glacier Blue and love that colour.My lower rating is mostly because of OxygenOS bugs that I mentioned above and flickering. Also, within a month of launch they reduced prices drastically. So if you can deal with these cons and high price, go for it. Else buy K20 for lower budget and iPhone 11 for higher budget. Happy shopping!

I am feeling disastrous and getting blamed by my spouse (iphone user) who suggestdd me to go for iPhone XR (available at 37K bow in offer) . Keeping fingers crossed for any update by oneplus and save my belief in the brand.Other Pros:- Solid body, Touchscreen is very responsive , camera is superb but not as good as iPhone 11 series, 3d sound amazing.Cons:- Keeps crashing while using camera and apps, New UI needs lot of tweaks., Deserved an earphone in package, triple camera position is elevated and chances of scratches increased

355,5.0 ,"  OnePlus 7T is a very good phone available at a very decent price. I paid ₹38k for the phone. I have been using this phone for about two weeks now.The delivery experience was great. My delivery was upgraded to express delivery for free and the product arrived within three days of placing the order.Moving on to the actual product. I think this phone might be the best phone at this price.The camera quality is great in natural as well as artificial light. Low light photos could be better. I love the super macro mode to take photos from super close to the subject.The battery life is great, but not excellent. But the super fast Warp charging more than makes up for it.The In-display Fingerprint reader is also super fast, but tends to miss 1/10 times.The 90hz screen my favorite feature of this phone, and the oxygen os is greatly optimized to make full use of the high refresh rate to give you a very smooth experience.OnePlus also gives out very quick updates for the os, which is another plus point for this phone.The transparent case provided in the box is also very good. It provides a good grip on the phone while also not hiding the beautiful back of the phone.One regret is that they don't provide a audio jack to usb-c converter in the box, which most others do.Overall the OnePlus 7T provides most of the features of a flagship at a pretty decent price.

359,5.0 ,"  OnePlus started it's series as the flagship/Nexus killer with the OnePlus Oneand now it has become the flagship. Except few hiccups like OnePlus 2 and OnePlus X, OnePlus has had a good run. OnePlus 7T is just another addition to its good phone list.This review is after almost two months of usage so will cover mostly all that people actually care about as a general user.1. Design is a very subjective opinion and depends on a person's taste. Personally, I'm not a fan of the circular camera but won't rate it as bad. However, the back panel is quite slippery and a fingerprint magnet so would suggest to go with a case.2. Display on 7T has followed the upgrade of OnePlus 7 Pro. 90 Hz is quite smooth but it isn't something which general users will care for in the long run. I still prefer the 1080p panel over 2K. The higher screen resolutions are just battery drainers and don't add quite much to the experience in my opinion. The screen is quite slim and tall which makes the phone a bit bigger for use. The waterdrop notch doesnt ruin the experience as such.3. Battery life wasn't upto the mark when I first received the phone and gave me mere 4-4.5 hours SOT which was quite disappointing from a newly purchased phone. However, the situation changed after I visited the service center and they reinstalled the OS to what came with the phone i.e. 10.0.4 and after which I updated it to 10.0.6. Since then battery has been really great. I have been getting 7+ hours of SOT on normal usage and around 6 hours with one hour of PUBG. After this tweak, the 30T warp charge does look like a bonus. I believe the 10.0.5 update which we received after getting the phone was somehow the culprit behind the battery drain.4. Camera has given me some mixed results. Not bad but not great either. Previously on my OnePlus 6T, the Gcam was doing a great job but since we haven't received a perfect Gcam for 7T yet, the stock camera is the better option to go and it clicks quite decent photos.5. Android: Before switching to OnePlus device, I was a Nexus user and I was quite used to the stock android experience. OnePlus provides just that with few extra tweaks which doesn't ruin the stock experience. They provide quite regular updates on their Oxygen OS which is quite commendable.Overall, OnePlus 7T is quite a great phone and can be recommended except that it'll get old in just six months. If you are looking for a new phone and this phone is on your mind, then you should go for it.There is one problem with the WiFi which I have noticed is that Wifi faces drops when connected to 5 ghz on some routers. It works perfectly fine on 2.4 ghz channel though.

361,4.0 ,"  The above photos are shot on the OnePlus 7t. I got this phone yesterday. I was really excited and looking forward to the phone. But, all my happiness was dampened when I turned on the phone for the first time. The phone went into an infinite boot loop in the first time itself. It went on for few hours even after charging fully. I was really saddened and couldn't find much help on the net. Fortunately my cousin found out some site, I tried the solution, which was factory data reset, and then it worked! The phone booted up normally. Since then it has been functioning smoothly. As I understand, this issue occured due to some issues with Android 10 and OnePlus, and it may not happen to everyone. Don't get me wrong, the phone is great and definitely value for money, and stands by what the reviewers have said. But as this problem happened to me, I would like to bring it to the notice of the manufacturer and people through this review. Definitely a great buy, but be vary of this boot loop issue. Best features of this phone are display, camera and storage. Don't think much before buying this, it won't disappoint you and will certainly surprise you in good ways. Coming from someone who has been using Android phones since the past 10 years.

The One Plus community is pretty strong here.6) It's worth your money, worth in the show of it;  Rest is all in detailsBest thing about 1+They ensure regular updates !!

364,4.0 ,"  I bought the mobile in the first sale on September 30, 2020. Reviewing it after 8 months.Pro's:1. Solid performance.2. Great 90Hz Super AMOLED fluid display. It feels very smooth throughout the UI.3. Fast charging capabilities and good battery life. Easily lasts a day in heavy usage.Con's:1. Camera's are good. But not great for the price we are paying for. Front camera is not even usable in some night shots.2. Lag of IP certification.3. Feels a bit heavy, while using in one hand.4. Huge camera bump.5. In 2020, it seems pricey comparing it's competitive.

365,5.0 ,"  The camera is very good but there were some changes in the colours while shifting lenses . Battery life is good, it can easily last u upto a day . Face unlock is amazing. but the finger print scanner is not so effective. The display is awesome. Oxygen Os is a bliss . The 90 hertz display makes my experience ultra smooth . Gaming on op7t is so good . U can play pubg on the highest settings

"
366,3.0 ,"  This was my 1st 1plus phone and honestly i didnt like it a bit. Yes oxygen os is good but the phone itself is average for the price. I have rog phone 2. While comparing the only thing i can say positive about this phone is... 7t feels lighter.. N thats it... Rog phone 2 is way way better than this in every aspect.

367,4.0 ,"  Finger print reader is not that fast, sometimes it takes two or three attempts.Camera is awesome, both front and back.Battery life is not that good. It drains almost 80% with just normal usage and video buffering in 10-12hrs.Zen mode is a good thing in the device.All other features are good.If bugs can be fixed with updates, its a very good device over all.Over all 4stars......

368,2.0 ,"  I had heard a lot about OnePlus phones, so finally thought of buying 1. Before this, I was using Samsung S8 which never hanged in 2.5 years, though the processor had become a slower over the time.But this new OnePlus phone has already hanged multiple times.Camera quality is nowhere near the premium phones. Leave the premium phones apart, Oppo provides better camera phones in 10K. The phone is also very heavy.OnePlus is fooling the buyers with new marketing techniques. Looks like, it pays to the famous gadget reviewers to over hype its products. Its performance is like any other chinese phone. Display colors are also not upto the mark.Now they have also started dropping the prices. If anybody wants to spend this much money on android phone, he or she should go for Samsung or Google Pixel phones

"
369,5.0 ,"  This is great leap in tech from my old OnePlus 6. I just fell in love with my 7T from day 1.Oxygen UI on Android 10 coupled with a powerful hardware has just made my day. The haptic feedbacks are amazing and the dual speakers just bring life to the media you steam on the fabulous display. Camera is a treat to watch, macro mode just kills it!!Peace of Advice: Put some decent protection to 7T with good hardcases to keep the all glass body safe. I have put UAG case to this task!!

371,4.0 ,"  Am not a OnePlus fanboy, infact this is my first OP. After 3days of usage this is what i think about this.Pros: 1-Design and build quality- the phone looks good, feels good in hand. Build quality is pretty solid. I feel the blue one looks better but that s subjective.2- Display- it is just gorgeous. The screen brightness is nothing like I have seen before. The 90 hz refresh rate is simply awesome.3- camera- the only two phones that I feel have better camera than this are S10 plus (also note 10) and the 11pro. There are few features in this that even those phones do not offer. Considering that this is almost half the price, I would consider this a win for OP.4- Oxygen OS- my last device was an Android one phone, so I was used to the stock Android experience. Oxygen OS takes the same experience and kicks it up a notch. It's just so smooth and provided some awesome customization.5- Charging speed- This has to be one of the fastest charging phone out there. Goes from 0 to 50 in about 20 mins.Cons- 1- no notification LED. 2- Haptics could be better.3- Display should have been quad hd at this price point.4- stupid notch. 5- A type C to 3.5 mm adapter should have been provided in the box. 5- Could use a bigger battery. 6- The always on display only works when you lift up or tap the phone

That's a bit disappointment and there's a problem with earphones also. The volume automatically reduces without even touching the phone. I'm way too disappointed with the purchase.

375,4.0 ,"  My package was delivered by Amazon Shipments. The Amazon delivery executive was very ill-mannered and that could be very costly during this pandemic. He didn't even wear a mask or maintain social distancing and I request Amazon to ensure that their employees keep their standards.I had initially planned to get an OP8. But since the stocks ran out quite fast in the flash sale, I chose to go for the OP7T. The 7T is pretty much all good for my personal needs and if I am to be a bit pragmatic, you don't really need a OnePlus 8 unless you really want that IP68 rating, 5G tech and the newest chipset.The 7T is pretty good and checks most boxes for me. It's fit for casual photography and gaming, and also has a 'one-whole-day' battery life even with my heavy usage. The fingerprint reader is much better than my previous 6T and camera quality is alright. The phone is pretty much very water-resistant but really, an official rating would've been a lot better.

"
376,5.0 ,"  I'm a regular oneplus user since OP1, my journey with oneplus was like OP1>OP5>OP7T, the phone is great, display is butter smooth thanks to 90hzs refresh rate, camera is great with right settings, video recording is superb, the OIS does commendable job, battery life could be issue if you always use at 90hzs, multitasking is great, overall a great value for money.

377,4.0 ,"  Got this phone March 5 as promised by amazon, appreciate the package and service delivery. Phone meets expectations in terms of performance and camera (with Gcam).Pros: 30 Watt warp charge is super fast in terms of charging.Triple camera setup is superb for day light as well as for night photography ( did install Gcam 7.3 for night & astrophotography)Display is super smooth and touch screen is fingerprint sensor is fastCons: Battery life could be improved, eats up lot of battery at 90Hz had to lower it to 60Hz to improve the battery performance. Phone lasts for one full day with medium to low usage.Keyboard: Looks like there is some known issue with android 10, switches out of application while typing in whatsapp.None other I can think off.

379,4.0 ,"  I switched from iPhone 8 Plus and here are my opinionDesign:Design could've been better, looks midrange, doesnt look premium.Display:I was excited for 90Hz display, which feels faster, still feeling like a gimmick. Resolution seems below average, images doesn't look that sharp, they look mediocre, however brightness is really good indoors, outdoors in sunlight kinda hard to see.7T Display is too narrow and feels like a tv remote to be honest and kinda feels weird for a phone. OP7 Display is long, wide and nice.Camera:I miss the images iPhone produces with natural colours. OP 7T camera is very midrange and not flagship level, images are yellowish indoors, portrait is below average and yellowish. Outdoor pictures are really good. I take lot of pictures and camera turns out to be a big disappointment for a flagship phone in 2019. Images looks like taken from a 15k phone than the 40k phone.Oxygen OS and Android 10:Oxygen OS is minimal and feels nice to use. Android 10 feels buggy, i experienced few lags, freezing, had to restart the phone at times which im not happy about.  Whatsapp and Instagram is not updated for Android 10 and has issues when trying to attach image, images in gallery looks tilted and blurry, i called OP tech support, they said its problem with 3rd party apps and not the device. So waiting for an update...Audio experience:Via Speakers or through earphones doesn't sound High Definition like iPhone sound, so this is a bit of a downer for me.Overall Experience:Phone is nice to use, however i had high expectations considering the reputation of OnePlus, phone turns out to be a mid range device for a premium price. I would say SKIP this please.....

"
380,5.0 ,"  It's been a month since I am using this phone and i have to say the performance is just incredible. The camera is highlighting point which performs extremely well especially for MACRO shots and portrait. The 48MP sensor is good. The Oxygen OS is pretty close to stock android. No customizations like custom skin. Thanks Amazon

"
381,4.0 ,"  Here are some of the things I noticed.RAM: Well the device is good but I think there is an issue with the RAM optimization. I was using it just for a day and found out that out of 8 GB only 19% of the RAM was left to use. Even though the phone didn't get slow at anytime. At first I thought it was due to the RAM boost thing they do with these oneplus phones but even after I turned RAM boost off and restarted the phone about 67% of RAM was available to use. Are these numbers normal? Idk.Internal memory: Even though it says 256 GB of memory the system takes up around 30 GB of memory. Like what the hell.Sound: Stereo speakers' sound is a charm to listen. The dolby atmos works even without the headphones. But you need content to take advantage of it.UI: The UI is too basic to my liking. I like Samsung's OneUI. But I think that's a personal thing.Fingerprint reader: I think it's the fastest in the industry. I mean I was using Samsung A50 and its fingerprint sensor barely even works. There is no comparison between the two but I'm just saying.Product Verification: idk where to verify if my unit is original since I haven't bought it from OnePlus site.P.S. This is my first OnePlus device and it looks good so far.

"
382,4.0 ,"  Overall Quality and performance of phone is really good. But the design of back camera should have been more efficient.And one plus should rethink of not providing earphones at this price range.

"
383,4.0 ,"  I have no qualms against the features which are provided. Overall it is a very good phone for the price you are paying. But one thing which they could have worked upon is battery life. I don't play games and all but I am on my phone a lot. The screen on time I get is around 5-6 hours. For me, it needs a full charge and a half charge to survive a day. But the warp charger is there.

"
384,4.0 ,"  Device looks and feels awesome in hand. Nice build quality. 90Hz refresh rate display is smooth. Rear camera module isn't that awkward as mentioned by many since we hardly see it. Camera performance is good though color difference is noticable when shifting between 3 cameras. There are few software glitches and bugs seen which are being fixed by updates. Still needs few updates to make the device bug free. Major down point is battery life which is not that great for continuous media consumption or gaming that too with 90Hz setting. But Warp charge comes as a savior. Delivery took its sweet time of 10 days which was a bummer.

"
385,5.0 ,"  You don't need 7t pro or 7 pro. Jsut buy 7t and save money plus no fragile curve screen. Buy 128 varient which was at the time of sale people got in 36k which a good price for such a package. Display, camera, smoothness every thing is great.I am going to write about cons because there are a lot of merit and few demeritCons :- battery backup, telephoto lens colour production, a bit heavy and tall, camera need few ota updates to produce natural image but it will get improve over timeThings can be improved - make it a bit small like 6.3, should have 3.5mm if not at least bundle a dongle, telephoto should have ois just like pro varient, can be a bit cheap if the phone was small in size

386,5.0 ,"  Battery is the only fear that i expect will be low but thanks to power management it is gently goes approx 22-23 hrs easily with normal working like 3-4 hrs youtube, internet, full day location on and more over calling more than 3 hrs in a day what i use daily. Very sufficient for me as unexpected from this 3800 mah battery only.Moreover camera quality is just mind blowing specially front camera and rear portrait mode and nightscape mode is awesome and also macro mode is just fantastic one...beat every segment of flagship....not its time to screen....so its like butter in ur hand....just one word to explain this mini moster is 'AWESOME'. My first oneplus phone it is and i just Love Oneplus.

387,1.0 ,"  I purchased this phone on 30 Sep and I have received 3 system updates till today. And now I am facing camera problem with main lense. It is capturing blurr images and videos.

389,5.0 ,"  I have been using this phone for over 2 weeks now and I thoroughly enjoying it. It is buttery smooth in all functions. I am not a gamer, but Boy! playing games like Asphalt 9 and Call of Duty is a treat on this phone. No heating issues at all. Charging speed is superfast. The phone went from 13% to 98% in just 40 mins. Oxygen OS , as always, is great to use. Cameras are also great this time, specially the inclusion of wide angle camera, although I wish it would have been a little wider. And I miss OIS on telephoto lens! That would have made the phone complete. The speakers are loud and clear, so no complaints there. Overall, I feel this is the best option under 40k for a flagship level experience, specially for it's software, 90 Hz screen and great performance. Beats every other Chinese brands for me, who are trying to impress everyone with all the specs, but no juice inside!

"
390,1.0 ,"  For a layman this phone is an absolute waste. My criteria for buying the phone were- A good charge holding through a day-Ease of taking photos-Ease of usage of messaging and other appsThe phone heats ups at the slightest of use and the I keep getting alerts that the phone temperature has been stabilisedThe charge of the phone will barely last you until noon with maybe about 10 callsbackground apps keep running even if you dont need. The ease of getting around the settings is cumbersome.If you open a video on whatsapp it dissappears into the back and only audio will keep playing. so embarassing when a call comes inYou cant silence the ring when the background video is playingAbsolutely unwieldy and dissapointingwilling to give away this phone to anyone who can pay me Rs.20000

"
391,3.0 ,"  I have been a loyal customer of OnePlus, bought with great expectations but disappointed with the product. My OnePlus 5T experience was better in almost all the areas. Very poor quality screen protector is on the phone started bubbling just after 3 days, OnePlus service is not even bother to respond even after repeated complaint.

"
392,1.0 ,"  Such a waste of money. In just few days i started hating this Phone, and within a week the price from 39,999 went down to 37,999 with some discounts, and nobody is willing to buy a hardly used Phone for even 33-34k. Regretting buying this OnePlus Crap.

"
393,4.0 ,"  Fingerprint Reader and Face Unlock both are quite fast and works perfectly mostly.Camera is very good at the price point, comparable to OnePlus 7 Pro but there is still scope of improvements.Battery life is good and lasts a full day for medium usage.The screen is really nice and cool with 90Hz refresh rate and looks brighter than other AMOLED display phones in that price range.However, there are some important omissions like lack of notification lights, Always On display feature, Low performance from front camera in low light etc.The pricing seems not reasonable since the competition is much higher now and most of the features are available at lower price range.To conclude, Impressive effort from OnePlus, Significant upgrade but costs more than the expectation.P.S. - The main plus of this phone is Oxygen OS and given hardware chipset 855+ SoC which makes the phone blazing fast.

396,4.0 ,"  For given price the phone is no more a flagship killer bjt has become a flagship phone to be killled by competition.The phone is well built, camera quality is decent, the screen is a good, Oxygen OS is one of the best in Android OS.The price is on very higher side, the phone doesnt has anything thats spectacular which may demand such a premium. The competition is offering same or better at low price point.If you want a OS with no bloat  and consider Oneplus brand to be good than you can buy one, but the phone is no more a value for money.If you care for value for money settle elsewhere.

It looks like it was designed with love and care Initial impressions, beautiful stunning display, camera looks great, android 10 and oxygen os feels fluid, refined and minimalistic. The refresh rate does make transitions and animations smoother. Macro photos look breathtaking. Unlocking via face or fingerprint is fast and hassle free. The premium glass finish back feels just right. Going to test the charging now.

"
398,3.0 ,"  Overall this is a good product of one plus except Bluetooth connection problem with the any music device like speakers, car music system and Bluetooth/Wireless earphone/headphone. This is the biggest problem with this product that the company has not provided space for wired headphones and we have only option of wireless products but the Bluetooth connection remains disconnected frequently and we have to light/on the phone or have to reconnect. One + provided software update for the same but the problem is still hanging and we are facing problems even after spent a big amount on so called flagship phone. Nowadays you can't enjoy your phone/device without Bluetooth connection working improperly. The second problem with the device is, it awake automatically even in your pocket even after on the pocket feature and start opening apps, wrong passwords attempts and sometime start music which is very embarrassing when you in meeting or public place. if 1+ cure these problems by software update then device is awesome otherwise not even good in this high price.

"
399,2.0 ,"  Here's my personal take on the new OnePlus 7T - Most of the reviews here is positive and yes it's probably a decent phone but unfortunately it didn't work out for me.I had couple of major problems with this - Overheating and battery discharge. I have been with the OnePlus ecosystem since their 3 model. The last one I had was 5. And it's very very hard to beat that edition. Probably I had higher expectations from 7T. The phone overheats while you're on a video call. It shoots up to 48-50 degrees and simultaneously discharges faster than Samsung. I have reduced the refresh rate, removed the animations, live wallpaper - still it's very mediocre.Just comparing with my OnePlus 5, it didn't feel like an update that's worth. The camera was never OnePlus's strong point and it remains with 7t. It's average at its best.The phone's generic performance is fluid as expected, but the flaws above didn't make the cut. I have returned mine and decided to go with something else.Cheers to those who liked this phone.

"
400,5.0 ,"  Inside the box:-You only get the handset and the charger and a transparent case, you won't don't get any headphones.Pros:-1) The one thing that attracted me to buy this phone is its Screen. Believe me it's the best part of this phone. You can clearly feel the difference between a 60hz display and a 90hz display. The amoled panel reproduces amazing colors and it also gets decently bright.2) Duel Speakers, this has 2 speakers. One in the bottom of the phone and one in the earpeice. I think this has Dolby Atoms as well. You ll have a really good experience when it comes to audio.3) The phone is really smooth and works like butter thanks to its 90hz Screen and top end specs, switching between the apps, scrolling feels really fast.4) Cameras - the cameras on this are pretty decent and the front facing camera is not a pop up one so no moving parts. The notch is small.5) Super fast charging - phone comes with the fast charger inside the box and it's crazy fast to charge the phone. It's faster than OnePlus 5.6) The Screen - ohhh the screen.. viewing content on this screen is mind blowing.. its the best part of this phone.Cons:-1) Size of the phone, when it comes to the dimensions of the phone I think it gets really tricky to handle this phone while typing or vertical use. Its a bit heavy as well. The phone is a bit thick as well as compared to Oneplus 5 my privious phone which was the perfect size and weight.2) I think the battery backup could have been better. The screen eats up the battery. I was not using my phone that intensively and still the battery drained faster as compared to my previous phone. (Fast charging helps though)3) No headphone jack - well this was going to be the deal breaker for me in buying this phone but I went for it. This phone doesn't have a headphone jack and also OnePlus doesn't even provide the type C to 3.5mm adapter out of the box.. will have to buy it separately or use bluetooth headphones which will again have a toll on the battery life.4) The big camera bump on the back. Yes it's too big and if you don't use a backcover you phone will always be uneven on the surface. It looks not that great too.5) And one thing that I noticed is that this phone comes with a pre applied screen guard, but the plastic doesn't cover the whole screen area, so when I had the back gestures enabled from the right bottom corner my finger used to scrach on that screen guard which was very unpleasant and I was worried that constant scratching might loosen the screen guard and it would peel off or something, so I had to disable those gestures and use the on Screen buttons to navigate.6) I dont know if its the software issue or the camera itself but the picture quality of the cameras is not that great or what I was hoping for.All in all.  This is a good phone for the price that it comes.

I'll sum it up in one word Phone is a BEAST!!It's worth every penny spent on this phoneIt'll easily last the whole day and oh man 90 hz dispaly is just super smooth and just amazingAnd coming to the camera the actual reason why I bought this phone was for that telephotic lens and I must say portraits do come out really good and will get better with updates and yes one thing I miss out from my old iPhone is the selfies. Selfie is average on this phone but don't get me wrong it's great but can't match up with iPhone selfies but yes portrait pictures can be compared with iPhone portraits but hey I was not willing to pay so much just for a portrait from an iPhone that's why ended up buying this beautiful OnePlus 7t and I don't regret it at all as I have saved a lot of money and most probably I'll buy a dslr or just use it for my travel and explore new places.Guys ,just close your eyes and purchase this device.

"
406,5.0 ,"  I have been using OnePlus 7T for the past week and based on my hands on experience I would say that this is undoubtedly the best smartphone under 40k. According to me the best past of OP 7T is the charging capability it has and I must say I have never seen somthing like this. The phone runs roughly 10-12 hours on one charge and for some, it's a bummer, but with 30 min. of charge you get ~70% battery, which in my opinion is superb.Some are saying its camera is not up to the mark but in my opinion it is superb moreover one must not forget that its camera is compared with iPhone 11(which is industries benchmark for camera comapison). Even if it doesn't exeed in comparison with iPhone 11's camera it is still way better than other companies camera in that price range.All in all I would recommend OnePlus 7T without any doubt.

"
407,4.0 ,"  The phone is really superb but I am really disappointed with ONEPLUS for not optimizing the software and fixing the bugs. Sometimes the Ambient Display is working and sometimes not, even after restarting and trying several methods it is not working but suddenly it will work from the next day or after some time. Then again it will stop working (like it is playing hide and seek).Also sometimes the phone heats while playing games for a few minutes but at a times it doesn't heat even playing continuously for some hours.EXCEPT THAT EVERYTHING IS PERFECT

Oxygen OS is the best UI after Pixel's Stock UI, but they are few bugs that as tobe fixed.3. 48MP camera takes good photos with some contrast (look OK) and ultra wide, telephoto also good. Need some software improvement for daylight photography.4. Nightsight 2.0 is worst, photos comes very smooth. In 7T and 7T pro, we can take Nightsight photos form ultra wide camera too that's very bad quality... Nightsight also need more software improvement.Good things about this device.1. Display feel so good, it as 1080p, 90hz.2. Android 10 gestures are very smooth with 90hz display.3. Performance is good.4. Battery life is good for me. (it's based on usage)

409,4.0 ,"  I am using this phone for a month now. Honestly it didn't meet my expectations keeping in mind the price. Below are my observations.Battery life is not great. For average usage, it lasts only for about 12 to 25 hoursCamera quality is good, though I was expecting front flash.One fundamental issue I observed is with selfie. Even average phones will negate the mirror image of text but it is not done by this high end phoneGPS quality is not good. I got jumbled maps with my fitness appCharger is very goodSome of the functions which are default in my previous phone (moto g5 S Plus) are not available in this phone.

"
410,1.0 ,"  8 hours battery life. Screen is unresponsive. Videos are not smooth. Simple applications such as sms and chrome hang repeatedly. This is the worst one plus I've ever used. Worse... The product is not returnable. Unhappy and cheated

"
411,3.0 ,"  1. As the Notification LED is not available in OnePlus 7T, it is very difficult to understand the Battery charge is full or not do we have any new message in the inbox etc.2. Each time we need to touch the phone to know these things.3. The notification for may of the APPs like Azan, IMO calls etc. are not working properly due to some advance level of battery saving. As switching off all the battery saving options, still the notifications are not working.4. It was better to keep an LED notification light around the front camera as circle for the design or ""Ambient display saying the notifications in the phone.5. Still more, I will update in the community.

Amazon is not allowing me to return the product which is strictly not acceptable.8. Pathetic user interface.Overall dissatisfied.... one should not pay such huge amount only for Camera quality.

"
413,1.0 ,"  Worst experience by wasting so much amount of money on a brand name like OnePlus.It has 8gb Ram but working like 1gb Ram.Fingerprint reader is also not working properly, it works fine sometime but I have a bad review for it.I am giving this review after usage of 1 month.All these may be related to my mobile only. It might be possible that Amazon India gave me product without checking quality.

414,5.0 ,"  The camera is superb if you're looking for a phone who has a good camera then go for ittttt!!It takes approximately 1 hour to charge my phone fullyI remember that before purchasing this phone i had read one comment which says that the phones heats upYaaa it does but not as much as redmi and etc phones doIt heats up a little bit which is not a big con as per as the pros of the phone areThe phone is a little heavy not too much but slightlyThe audio quality is superbbbbb!!!One plus had provided with a separate button for silent vibrate and ring mode basically you have to slide the buttons to get whichever mode you wantThere is no earphone jack so that's disappointing but else this phone is supperrbbb go for it!

"
416,4.0 ,"  It's been two days I got my one plus 7t mobile. Pls find my observation below1. Camera quality superb both back and front - 5/52. Performance is more than expected - 5/53. Fingerprint reader is good but not so quick as it should be. It's taking more time - 4/54. Battery is under Power. As per the costing it is not justifying the capacity of only 3800mah It's not that much good it should be atleast 4300mah. Needed to charge twice for medium use - 3/55. Display is super. Can be visible in outdoor condition I.e. high sun light - 5/56. Phone has overheated in starting but now no issues. May be due to the first start up processes and upgrades. I have done all the things like installation and upgrades in the same time. After restarting it is working fine, phone temperature is in between 30-38°C So as per my understanding no overheating issues7. No frame lagging if playing any HD games.8. Dash charger is super. Charging mobile just in 60 minutes.

"
417,5.0 ,"  I love everything about this phone except the fact that it is chinese. The camera quality is top class it has 4k 60 fps recording that is vey good. The macro mode and the zoom mode is top class. It's processor is just amazing, I can run pubg at HDR extreme fps. Although it may have some heating issues but no problem it is fixable you just need to update it's software. I also like One Plus's Red Cable Club. When you make a One Plus Account then join the red cable club from the seetings and you will have 6 months of extended warranty that means whatever the warranty was given with the phone, 6 months will be added.

"
418,5.0 ,"  Bought a gift for my brother, the phone, the package and the presentation was excellent.Pro - Camera output is the best! Great processor output! Seamless gaming and streaming experience! 90Hz refresh rate is Magic to eyes and the feel of the Engine Haptic Feedback is unbelievable.Con - Battery is small for a large screen and such high processor. OP should have atleast dished out 4500/5000 mah power to make the phone last a day or more with such high specs.Was planning to buy ASUS rog 2, however the final selection with OP7T is worth every penny. First time OP user and hence can say Oxygen OS is 10 on 10.

419,1.0 ,"  Slow motion camera quality is not good. And main thing is video editing option is totally bad. I can't edit any vdo in this phone edit software.

Now i am thinking that why i hv not bought vivo or oppo reno 2 much better options than this.

420,2.0 ,"   My review of this phone is after using for 6mnts.I just bought this mobile because of its popularity . Now i realised it is not worth of 40k .The price is so high coz of their market startegy and they dont have their own manufacturing industry in India.I say this phone is worth of 28k.ProsBuild looks premium.Fingerprint and face unlock is fasterIts handy only if ur palms are big.Performance is fine when compare to oppo or vivo(only slight difference not much)Video or photo clarity are good only on good lighting conditionConsCamera bump, it irritates.Camera quality is not good at night even with night mode. Lots of distortion and photos are polished.Many times i have observed phone getting hanging on and to get back normal i have to restart.Also once i have seen whatsapp audio was running background even after killing the app.

"
421,5.0 ,"  I have been using a Samsung Galaxy S8 for the last 2 years and switched to the OnePlus 7t 256 GB a couple of weeks ago. My feedback based on the 2 weeks of rigorous use vis-à-vis the Galaxy S8 –Pros:- Amazing 30w Warp Charge is the fastest I have seen. My rigorous use means I need a big battery and being a Samsung loyalist had considered the M30s. However, the sub par specs other than that massive battery on the M30s meant I went for the 7t and I am happy that I chose this.- The finger print sensor is much better than the Samsung S8 and the haptics are also quite good. Overall the cell phone also feels faster than the S8 in day to day usage and the data access is also visibly faster.- One grouse I always had with the S8 was that the speaker loudness whether on a phone call or listening to the single speaker was terrible for a flagship phone. By comparison the stereo speakers of the 7t are brilliant. I actually have to turn down the speakers listening to YouTube videos it is that loud.- The box comes with the fantastic warp charger and surprise, surprise a basic transparent case. I purchased a more robust case as I am prone to dropping my phones but it is a nice gesture by OnePlus. The idiots should probably have included a USB C to 3.5mm jack as well but then there’s no end to asking for freebies.Cons:- The biggest negative is the screen quality. I don’t mind the 1080p resolution as I also ran my S8 in 1080p to save battery. The problem is that the 7t screen never feels vibrant like the S8 despite adjustments. The back lighting is inconsistent and feels patchy. And for some reason, the Auto backlight adjustment seems to always set up the screen darker than it should. In summary, nothing comes close to a Samsung AMOLED.- Another aspect of the screen that bugs me is that the oleo phobic coating on the screen or rather the pre applied screen guard is terrible. The screen always looks dirty as compared the superb black mirror look of my Samsung S8.- The reason I almost didn’t purchase the 7t was that it offers no SD Card support. I did opt for the larger 256 GB variant but I would still prefer the choice of putting in my own micros SD. I also don’t like the lack of a 3.5mm headphone jack but that doesn’t affect me much.  I have shifted to the Jabra 65t Elite BT headphones for everyday work. I use a Dragonfly Red DAC with OneMore Quad Drivers for music listening on flights.- Using the phone over a 40 minutes drive with Android Auto I found the phone heating up. Samsung S8 never had this issue because Samsung is extra cautious about heat management after the exploding Notes episode.So far so good with the OnePlus 7t. It is superb value as compared to the Samsung S10 range. The S10e that has specs at par with the S8 of nearly 3 years ago is a rip off at 50k+ and the other S10 phones are daylight robbery of even greater magnitudes.Simply put, I take my phone selection very seriously and frankly there seems to be no phone that can offer better value and user experience at this price range.

"
422,5.0 ,"  OnePlus 7T:I rarely change mobile phones only when and if it is required. My average mobile lasts me 3-5 years before I change one.I opted to go for 7T this time. My review for past one week is :Design- I believe this is purely based on personal preference. For me I really like the overall design and color. It does not feel cheap and has premium feel to it.Display: The is display is a gem and feast to the eyes while at 90hz. The games work smoothly and the touch response is really good.  My eyes do not feel strained and you also get the option to change it to 60hz to save battery. If coming from a layman's perspective you will even enjoy the 60hz display just because the display is Crystal clear.-DC Dimmimg is addition feature which the OnePlus has added to avoid screen flicker at low brightness and some of the users have been still facing the issue. From my personal experience I did not face any of such issues and the feature worked flawlessly. I believe this is more of certain product issue and this is something which OnePlus needs to address. If they don't mean to settle just like their OnePlus 7 range then they need to address this issue.Camera: Camera works flawlessly. However, Some people liked the camera bump on 7T and some didn't. Personally, I don't mind till the time it serves it's purpose. Just need to take a bit care of it. You will enjoy clicking pictures from this camera. The macro lens provides a very good perspective while clicking the pictures. Although, I feel the camera does make the pictures a little warmer. The nightscape mode provides a clear pictures at night. However, I think it could have been better. The pictures could also have been a little more sharper.Overall pretty good camera.UI: It works flawlessly with regular updates. Yes, I already got one within a week of owning it. Nothing more to say here.Fingerprint reader: One of the fastest scanner I have come across with multiple animated options to choose from.Overall- 4/5I'm enjoying using this phone and I have been appreciating the thought process gone though everything while making this device to provide such a beast.-No heating issue. Fnatic mode, Gaming mode works efficiently. All the games including COD, PUBG, Asphalt, Temple Run work brilliantly at Max settings.***Also you get the back cover and screen protector with it. If there is any update on regards to the over all functioning of the device then I will make sure to update it over here.

423,5.0 ,"  Propably the best smartphone under 40k. It has all that features of  flagship phones have right now. Starting with super fluid amoled display with 90  Herz refresh rate, fingerprint reader to face unlock  , everything is so perfect in this phone. Also battery life is very , with 90-100% battery it can barely last for one day and half which is at par for every descent user out there. Now coming to the most important segment i.e., camera, OnePlus is not known for its camera qualities bt for the first time they have really worked hard to put up all the flagship level camera qualities in this one. If you are looking for good camera , better battery life, smooth display experience and Oxygen OS. It is the best t version of OnePlus among all the other previous phones. All this qualities make it a must buy.

"
424,5.0 ,"  Here's an honest review of the OnePlus 7T.Want a best phone under 40k go for this one without thinking twice. I'm saying this because i have literally researched every other phone falling under this category i.e., the ₹40000 bar.Pros1. Great display.  Seriously awesome display vivid colours and great brightness outdoors plus its a flat screen which is a big thumbs up coz I'm not really into curved displays for however pleasing they may look but in practicality not to good.2. Battery.  Battery life is just marvelous. Lasts for me about a whole day doing normal usage and 6-7 hours of heavy usage.Also Warp charge is just plain Awesome. Takes about 45 min to fully charge from 10-15%.3. Sound.  Dual stereo speakers are just great. Immersive sound experience. Loud and clear4. Oxygen OS  It is the best there is without any doubt. Better than samsung one ui or any other.5. Camera  Triple camera system is really good. Wide angle is 117° so a little short than other wide angles which are 120° but doesn't make any difference. Great pictures and videos.The macro shot is just great. Indoor and outdoor clicks are good. If your thinking iphone comparable quality just don't but is great for its price. Wouldn't regret buying it.Cons1. Minor bugs here and there that can be fixed with updates which is what OnePlus is good at.Updates are frequent and shows that they work really hard at this.2. Some people won't like the circular camera system so I'm writing in the cons but its just a matter of personal view. It doesn't bother you with anything.3. No 3.5 mm to type-c connector in the box.4. Some won't like the plastic TPU case but that's what you get.Anyhow it is the best phone there is right now better than OnePlus 7 pro and 7T pro actually.So no need to worry just go for it.If any questions just ask.If you are missing headphone jack buy a Bluetooth headset. I would recommend Sony WI400. 15 hrs battery. 1 hour charging time with warp charger ofcourse and pretty good range. Also great base and awesome sound. Priced at ₹3500.

Bought 7t and they gave 2 year warranty as compliment. Big thank youAlways OnePlus fan.. had 1+ 5  but during Indian festival xchanged with 7t (got 9900 discount).People complain about battery but dude it's 90hz display and very powerful speakers.While playing pub battery drain too much but u don't require any headphone.

Then realized that people have been sent soap and marbles in such packaging in the past that Amazon had to secure it from the middlemen who sneak it through.The 7T is a powerhouse and yet it saves a lot of power to push you through the day. All in all, the phone is excellent with a lot of tinkering options available for you to play with this handful of tech marble(not marvel). But the irony is not lost on the fact that I have clicked the attached pics with one of the better camera phones (Honor 8 pro) for the review. Will update with the pics clicked by 7T soon. Thanks to Amazon for the timely delivery and Thanks OP for maintaining the quality and challenging the status quo.Never Settle OP.

I need a replacement with working product.UPDATE AFTER REPLACEMENT:I'm so glad that I requested the replacement, I have no heating issues with the same usage on new phone.Many people suggested than this much is normal, you will face same problems even after replacement becaues the hardware will be the same- what difference is it going to make, upper right corner gets heated up and bla bla, but it made the difference, I love the phone now.There are bit of issues like - hanging while selecting images to upload on WhatsApp, Instagram, facebook etc, once I had to restart to get back to function, but I hope it will go away with software updates.P.S. this image issue I have noticed in 7 Pro as well.

431,4.0 ,"  Honest review after use of 1 week.Pros -Camera in daylight is amazing. Supermacro shots are wonderful and crisp. Inbuilt AI works smooth and detects the scenes in quite good manner.Telephoto, wide angle and portrait altogether compiles very good camera setup.Front Camera is similar to what we have in one plus 7.Processing is smooth like butter, no lags whatsoever. Have got about 90 apps apart from the bloated one's. Opened , worked ,performs very well.Gaming is brilliant,also the new haptic feedback adds cheery on the cake for gaming.Sound quality is superb ,both the speakers are tuned and doesnt make any noise or irritation kinda even when it is full. 360' sound effect feels amazing.Display is very very crisp,clear and Bright. Everything is perfect. Even though its not above 1080p , but never fails.Battery - Complete 1 day backup for 100% charge. And if 1 or 2 hours goes less, WARP charging is always there.Cons -No headphone Jack.The nightscape is waste it seems. Sometimes its giving patches on the subject making it feel like its painted or something. Not good at all. Hope One plus provides updates on regular intervals for improving this.Fingerprint reader is not much fast compared to the other devices, however face unlock works perfectly fine. Expecting fingerprint reader will improve in future updates.Bundling everything in one word - ""Beast"" altogether.Go for it. Peace.#Oneplus: Never Settle

438,5.0 ,"   Just finished setting it up and initial impressions have been very good. Although I have to say I was expecting a big box which had some extra goodies, like the many youtubers (including Indian ) had been showing. I would suggest OnePlus to at least include them as a part of a deal. Any way once I started using the phone, all my complaints started fading away. That 90 Hz display gives a butter smooth touch experience.2 days usage Update:*About the big box goodies mentioned in previous review above, they are available on OnePlus portal. So be ready to shell out money for the same.*camera is not in the league of iphone 11 or Galaxy Note 10 or even Pixel 3 but it ain't that bad either. But Macro mode is a big saviour.*Display is definitely the best part of the phone, along with the processor SD 855+*Stereo Speakers can be pretty loud and clear*Battery is again not as good as iPhone 11 or Galaxy S10+ but it would be enough for a day's usage. And why worry much when we have warp 30T charger*I wish they could have included at least USB Type C Bullet earphones.*Overall quite content with the phone.

We all know OP makes best Android mobiles and Oxygen OS is incomparable. Touch is smooth as silk and performance outstands every other Android phones. The only thing I want to mark out is the battery. OP could have given atleast 4k mah battery. It drains really fast after continuous use.But yeah, WARP charging is totally crazy. It's unbelievable. This is another part of the story which makes me forget the first part of the story.i.e.draining.Love you OP. OP7T ROCKS!! 🤟

446,5.0 ,"  Phone is truly a beast with all latest tech built within.Built quality - 10/10 with fine detailed finishing and sturdy device. Waterdrop notch i like it personally. But does not have notification lights(i personally prefer to have it).Camera - quality has improved drastically after latest update. Images are too good just loved it. Can be improved with some ar stickers and stuff to add fun element in camera.Android 10 OS - OS is a bit buggy where application and touch hangs abrubtly and issue is intermittent but definitely annoying, as least you would you expect is smooth experience with software part after paying 39999₹ for the device. I think one plus have pushed android 10 bit early just for releasing updated oneplus 7t phone. They might resolve the issue with software upgrades.Sound - 10/10 Experience is very good with and without headphones. Phone comesnwith dual speaker and provides truly stereo effect.Battery - 7/10Battery charging is very quick with warp charging but it drains thatbquickly as well with minimal usage. It hardly lasts for me upto 20-24 hours(which i say is less from my past exp with other phones having similar battery capacity and non amoled display)Display - 10/10 You will definitely fall in love with the amoled display and video viewing experience is simply superb.

447,5.0 ,"  This is my first Oneplus phone and bought this after a looooot of research. Happy to realize that my choice wasn't bad. Yeah, if they release OP8 at a lesser price within next 2 months, it's gonna hurt, but that's the reality these days.Pros:1. Best camera in this range, hands down. There are no second questions as of now. Color profiles vary a little when you switch between cameras but I'm sure next update from oneplus will solve this.2. Fastest phone in this range. ROG 2 is another option but that's for gamers and is not a practical phone for most people.3. Display 90Hz is super fluid. It isn't quad HD unlike 7 pro or 7T pro. But this is the best in this price range.4. Software: Android 10 plus Oxygen OS. I bought this phone for this combo. Best as of now. Zen mode, night mode, reading mode, chromatic mode, greyscale mode, digital wellbeing, dark mode, the list goes on. You name it; this phone has it. Love it 3000.5. Speakers: Beast. Very loud and crisp.6. Design: 20:9 makes it easy to handle. Weight is balanced, can manage most stuff with one hand. Rear can design may be a problem for some. Camera bump isn't an issue at all since everyone is going to use a case. My Moto Z had similar bump, the case takes care of it.7. Battery: I wad skeptic about 3800mah plus 90Hz display combo. But this phone surprised me. Battery life is really good, easily 5.30 to 6hrs SOT depending on your usage in 90Hz. If you are traveling you can always switch to 60Hz for longer life. Plus the super amazing charger. I think few early reviews dint have the latest oxygen update which should have improved the battery life.Cons:1. No 3.5mm output.2. No type-c to 3.5mm converter or type-c headphones in the box: Oneplus could at least give people a 100rs converter for buying a 40k phone. Who wants the useless super fancy box right?3. No IR blaster.4. No notification LED.5. No ""always on"" display.6. No micro sd slot.I can't think of any other con. Will update if I find any.Adding some amazing night mode pics shot by both stock camera and gcam. All these pics were shot at 10PM.Battery screenshot: Dint play any games. Usage was mostly whatsapp, chrome, camera, and youtube. Dark Mode enabled. 90Hz enabled.Edit.Second screenshot: Includes 1hr 37 min pubg, 1hr 15min youtube. Single sim, wifi and 4g data always on, did not use GPS much.

448,4.0 ,"  As a user who have never used an android before, OnePlus was my first choice to consider and it did not fail to deliver.Pros:+Amazing OLED screen+Super fast display (90Hz)+Gaming mode to enhance the gaming experience+Superb wide angle camera+Lots of customization options for apps+Parallel apps functionality similar to Samsung Note series+Amazing overall performanceCons:From what i have used so far,-Camera(1): Auto focus issue when its in the battery saver mode. Sometimes in the normal mode too.-Camera(2): No detail in photos when compared to other high end models in the market. Nevertheless the photos are amazing and you cannot find anything bad when you glance at it.-Crashing of apps (rare and common in Android)Summary: For the money and its value wrt options and perfromance, its a great phone and a must buy.

"
449,5.0 ,"  Simply amazing!! The screen quality is awesome, the speakers on both sides of the phone provide great music quality, the camera is excellent i don't think anyone else can matchbits camera quality, the unlocking time either by face recognition or fingerprint reader is lightning fast, the charging time is very quick like half an hour of charge will get it to 70%+, i played pubg on it for 7 hours in a single day and there was no lag or heating and the battery discharged slowly... Overall if you want the top quality performance... Just go for this phone

"
450,4.0 ,"  OVERALL RATING: 4.5/5Design(4.5/5): Sleek, easy grip, light weight, great body, robustProcessor(5/5): Extremely smooth usage. You can actually see the difference if you had been using 60Hz screen earlier. Phone doesn't hang and extremely smooth transition between application.Phone can take up large size games like Fifa, Mortal Combat, Pubg, Asphalt, etc without any heating in the device and moreover, by default settings is HD which is pretty impressive.Battery(3.5/5): Can last long. But compare to other previous series of One Plus, slightly on lesser side. I don't consider it drawback and can be adjusted with.Sounds(5/5): Perfect Dolby system. Clear and crisp.Touch(5/5): Smooth. Easy finger sensing.Camera(5/5): Absolutely fantastic.  Micro mode is just amazing and pictures doesn't fade out. Face lock also work fantastically apart from basic triple camera.Aesthetics(4/5): Width wise you may find it pretty less as compared to other phones in the market in similar category. But hardly noticeable. Light weight. Round camera on the back might bother you but it has come with great protection so you don't need to worry about it.You will not have audio jack. Hence you will have to but C type converter.

"
451,5.0 ,"  It's my second onplus phone, everything is awesome. Can't compare this flagship device with any other.

"
452,3.0 ,"  The battery optimisation is extremely poor. The battery just drains like anything. Needs to be charged twice a day. One cannot carry the wrap charger everywhere.Wrap charger is great but that dosent call for total lack for battery optimisation,especially when you are putting a powerhungry 855+ and battery consuming 90htz screen.Rest of the phone is just awesome. Oneplus needs to address this heating and battery draining issue as soon as possible with better optimisation like Huawei (the smaller battery have great life better than even big battery)They Must roll out update to fix this issue.. Oneplus are you listening?

"
453,3.0 ,"  Everything Is almost fineBut when it comes to fingerprint sensor and battery it sometimes disappoints.1.fingerprint is fast but not too fast plus many a times cause problem in fingerprint reading and hence uses face unlock.2.battery is draining fastly even in 60hz refresh rate and that's a bit disappointing me I expected something more better from one plus.battery never felt like what they said.3.lots of heat up.4.some software bugs but they can be fixed with updates so they are good and some missing also but the major problem are the above three.Though it's a 2day usage view of me if any thing more come to me will update it as well.Battery draining is worst but backed up y ultra fast warp charge 30T

"
454,4.0 ,"  I like OXYGEN OS with 90HZ refresh rate ,which is the smoothest ever I had ever used so far.This is my first flagship phone over 30K .bought for 33500 after all discounts.Pros:Software,Camera -sony 48 MP blows like anything.Charging speed with 30W wrap charges within 50 minutes .Sound quality .It is clear and crispy.Dolby with stereo speakers are amazing.Cons-Battery capacity is bit smaller.But the phone is not much weight and it is so slim because of compromise on battery capacity.This couldn't be a problem with charger given out of box.There are no other cons for me.It is the best in UI .Those who are wishing to experience best UI and watch more videos can buy it blindly.

"
455,5.0 ,"  The device is addictive..Performance is very good..After an update the ambient display feature stopped working, I complained and requested for replacement, however it started again automatically...In a seven week time the phone came out the be winner.The battery is small and gives 8-10hrs now to heavy user and 15-20 hrs to light with 90 htz refresh rate setting. However at 60htz refresh rate the battery performance increases manyfold and is more than sufficient.. it is surprising that in the starting the battery performance is not very good but as I used the device the battery performance has increased so much. The one plus team should also include battery health feature like iPhone.FRONT camera is not as wow as rear..Needed improvement for sure..If one plus team is reading this then you guys should enhance front camera quality..Ear phones is not included in the box.. which one plus should include as they have not given 3.5mm jack..Overall I would rate 4.7 out of 5 now.. also this is the third time I am editing my review and each time my ratings have only increased..There are some heating issues which I recently encounter.. and when the phone heated this time it's ambient display feature again stopped working.. something unsual from one plus.

"
457,5.0 ,"  Overall performance of phone is good.. 90hz display does play a vital role in enhancing the performance and on top of it oxygen os provides great UI but comes with few bugs. Phone comes with latest Android 10, hence few system updates.. few things that are missing are:-- Popup camera- Faster fingerprint reader- Wireless charging- 3.5mm audio jack- Powerful battery backup like we have in other phones.Asus ROG phone 2 provides better hardware but camera quality is best in OnePlus

"
458,4.0 ,"  Edited after 3.5 months of use:Overall phone is awesome.Pros: 1. Battery life is good, it last for a day with on screen time 4 to 5 hrs.2. Processer speed is awesome.. no lag..3. Fingerprint reader and face recognition works well.4. 90 Hz screen smoothness is amazing5. Camera quality is as good as professional camara.Cons:Phone feels much heavier with 191grams + cover

"
459,5.0 ,"  So after using for months I am ready to review it ,and I am damn satisfied with the speed and premiumness provided by OnePlus to its users.Frankly speaking about its camera, speaker,display,processer,gaming expirence it's fantastic guys.The only negative thing most of user will experience can be having no 3.5mm headphone jack, but in this era of Bluetooth headsets an earphones it doesn't bother much.Anyways let's compare with the Nord and I can say I am good to go with the 7t.You can buy it without any other option in mind.

"
460,5.0 ,"  Camera and battery are highlight in this phone.Camera is too good and battery life comes upto 5-6 hours which is really good. A back case and pre applied screenguard comes with is mobile which is impresive. The look of the phone damm good.The only disadvantages of the phone are*Out of 256 gb 29 gb is taken as system storage*Only wireless and type c earphones can be used for this phoneOverall , go for it

"
461,5.0 ,"  After using it for 3 days I would say with assurance that it is the best buy in the range between 30k to 38k. Fingerprint sensor is lightning fast,face unlock is good. Can't say much about battery but finding some issues in the camera. Photos are crystal clear but when I take group photos I notice a distortion in the facial structure, particularly the distant faces. I am yet to know if it's due to settings. If not it's a serious issue.

"
462,5.0 ,"  I have been using this for 4 months now. The best phone I've used by far. Everything is perfect and I use this a lot for work. Perfectly satisfies my need for speed. The battery and charging speed alone puts a smile on my face everytime and I especially love the macro mode on its camera. No complaints as such but if I really want to nitpick, a faster fingerprint sensor would've been perfect. 5 stars from me in any case.

"
463,4.0 ,"  After 60 days of usage my reviewCamera is OK,the cam sometimes adds more colours to the frame Install GCAM and everything is fineBattery life GOOD but if you are a gamer and early streamer you need to charge and play, screen time was  5-6hrs on 90hzBest OS No need to mentionI recommend to buy OnePlus bullets Z if you are a gamer low latency during pubg0-100 charge in 80mins

"
465,5.0 ,"  OnePlus as always comes with full of surprises. When you will use this phone u will get addicted to it. The display with 90hz is just amazing. Camera on other hand is a masterpiece actually i bought this phone because of its camera performance. OnePlus should add a 960fps option in the camera otherwise it is just amazing.One thing i will complain about this phone is that I don't why but this phone keeps on heating up with normal usage like calling,video playing etc.

467,5.0 ,"  I bought it for 35k in the month of May. I was in a dilemma between OnePlus 8 and OnePlus 7t. But after watching reviews on YouTube and my friend's experience on using OnePlus 8, I've decided to go for 7t only. This is my honest review after using this mobile for a day. This mobile is one of the best looking, performance centric mobiles that I've used in my life. Literally, I felt so happy and satisfied after using this mobile. For 35k, it a paisa vasool mobile. Just go for it if your budget is around 35k. Kudos to OnePlus and Amazon for bringing up this mobile to us.

470,5.0 ,"  Was using iPhone 6S Plus since four years which got fell and its screen cracked was still working fine but there was other issues due to which I switched like overheating, not getting 4G speed on Jio, 2GB ram in 2020 means apps reloading.So any ways back to Oneplus 7t this is my first Oneplus mobile ever and i m enjoying it i like its Speed, 4G LTE (now i don't have to move around my mobile to get that speed which i had to do on iPhone), Camera is very good, Battery life i m getting for a day and yes that fast charging is absolutely time saver also no overheating just gets warm while charging but no heating during my usage!I Would Recommend not to update your OS unless there is major bug and u need that fixed.My Oneplus 7t's manufacture date is 18-10-2019 came with Android 10 Oxygen OS ver 10.0.1 and i m not going to update it no bugs for me in this ver.

"
471,2.0 ,"  The biggest con of this phone is battery. It won't stay for full day after a full charge. Drains too quickly. Attached is the image. Also battery drains faster in battery saver mode which defeats its purpose. Since there is no return, I have to live with this phone. The standard cover provided by company is tacky. They could hv included a proper cover for such a price. Oh and not to mention the packaging. Whosoever packed it, packed it thinking it's a brick and not a phone and I could see the delivery person tossing the packages so one can imagine the condition of phone which isn't properly packed.  Overall not satisfied with spending so much.Edited:After using it for couple of months, found out that camera quality is cheap.  Zoom just simply worst not even 8 megapixel. They should return the money of the customers.

"
472,5.0 ,"  The dispaly is really good. Missing the front camera flash.Battery should have been bigger with 5000maH. The Snapdragon 855+ chipset is not very power friendly. Although no heating up and the performance is above expectation with s teen refresh rate to choose from 60 Hz to 90 Hz.Beacuse of the battery life the phone lags a little behind other competitors. Of battery is increased to 5009

"
473,4.0 ,"  The phone is excellent for everyday use and performance wise.Highlights:-1. The camera performance is mind blowing, you will be amazed with the camera shots and night mode. The pictures barely need any after edits if you want to directly post on Instagram.2. Charging is super fast. No complains, phone is ready for use in half n hour.3. Overall performance, RAM management, storage speeds, oxygen OS, 90hz display is as usual very good. Refresh rate is definitely noticeable to me but it depends on person to person.Some negatives:-1. The slightly disappointing thing is the battery performance which is just average. It has improved quite a lot after recent updates but not extraordinary.2. The display is awesome but it might appear too bright sometimes, need some sort of feature to lower the glare sometimes.3. Fingerprint reader is fast but not the best finger detection.4. A major problem for one who has small hands is that the phone is very tall. It is very hard to type, I have had the toughest experience to type on this phone.

"
474,5.0 ,"  Battery : Not so good. Update : after using Battery is awesome, basically battery management is great, if used minimally it can go for 24+ Hours, average - 12-15 Hours, Heavy usage (continuous) - 8-10 Hrs approx.Charging : Blazing Fast. Warp Charge is something time saving thing.Graphics : AmazingCamera : 4k Video is Awesome but Limited to 5 Minutes, stabilization mode is good, Pics are perfect, Macro Mode is fantasticSlo-Mo : Great, but still no support for 960fpsSpeakers : Fantastic Sound, Dual Speakers with Dolby Atmos, u can watch any thing with full sound experience, Bluetooth headphones sound better with Dolby, overall good performanceBut No Headphone Jack.Overall Awesome Phone.Thanx Amazon.

477,5.0 ,"  I was skeptical before but after purchasing the phone, I'm completely satisfied with it.Pros:1. Refresh rate of 90hz makes the transitions fluid.2. You get Android 10 out of box.3. Oxygen os is close to stock Android, so it's not full of bloatware  and is free of any ads4. The unboxing experience is worth mentioning.5. The triple camera setup does a commendable job.Cons:1. Battery of 3800 mAh is considerably less. The phone lasts a day  with 9hrs screen on time2. If you are switching from iPhone then you'll face little hickups  while transferring the data.3. There's no headphone jack, so you'll have to go with a Bluetooth  headset or have to buy an extra connector

478,5.0 ,"  First of all their is no comparison, just go for it without a single thought fast finger print sensor. Face unlock is so fast and work till 5 foot steps so be aware anyone can unlock your phone specially recommended to those who are in relationship😅😅.Camera is awesome even in low light you can get best shots, I don't think we need some extra lens for micro photography as OnePlus is already giving. If you want to make video while walking you can do because the stability is amazing.Battery life is not so good not so bad I can say average and the best part is warp charger which will charge 100% within 50-55minsAs every mobile adapting wireless technology but still if there will be earphones jack port will be there it's good to have.

482,5.0 ,"  Here is what I feel about the mobile.If you have budget to spend 36000 rupees (which will easily be used for 3-4 years so ROI is pretty cool) either in single payment or through EMI. I suggest to go for it. Its a great phone in the price tag.Once a smart person said : You cannot go wrong with oneplus and I felt the same way.Hit Features of the phone :The 90Hz display is a delight to work with.Camera.The software(it's as important as the great specs a phone offers)Smallest notch.Audio quality.Premium looks and feel.Shortcomings:Sab maaf..!!People are complaining about it's battery life. Though it's early to say but it has a pretty decent battery backup and fast charging is again what makes this phone a strong buy.What I want to say is I loved this and won't disappoint you either ..!! ❤️

ITS INSANE)- some apps are showing issues where some apps are stretched beyond the screen- camera works great, better than a lot of Samsung products in the same price range- sound quality is insanea phone worth buying

489,4.0 ,"  Low Light Photography is still not improved also we've observed much noise and distortion in captured image.I hope post Zoom what will happen is no need to say.Market is flooded with 48 MP phones in low price budget. But in spite being at so high price range Camera is not up to the mark.Front Camera scanning in face unlocking doesn't found to be super quick.In good light this does capture nice images like other brands available in market right now.In short, at least this Camera Lense doesn't give that Wow kinda feel or something amazing outcome.Battery Life :- As per use it's sufficient. But interesting thing is it's charging speed amd time required. Good note for it.Fingerprint Sensor :- This Sensor works better and at quick lightning unlocking.

"
490,4.0 ,"  Switched from Oneplus 3 to 7T.Main reason for sticking to Oneplus was there software support over long term. Oxygen OS is veey snappy combined with best hardware till date.The performance difference between OP3 and OP7T is very big. I was comfortable with performance of OP3 till i started using 7T.Web page rendering,animations are very fluid(maybe due to 90hz refresh).Design wise i like narrow ergonomic design.It is confortable for one hand usage though it is slightly heavy. Buttons are very tactile and clikcy.The alert slider is much better compared to one on OP3.Camera is good nothing exceptional.Speakers are very good for media and call.Display brightness is slightly low, could have been better.I don't like the notch. It ruins overall experience.Most of the time it is hidden in black bars and most video playback don't support notch(tested in Chrome,Amazon Prime).Moreover video content is very limited for this aspect ratio as of now.Battery life is average. Same as three year old OP3.If you are heavy user and always on the go,then it may not last till evening.(I always keep 90hz on,else what's the use of paying for such feature.)A bigger battery is definitely a miss here.I really miss 3.5mm jack. Bluetooth options are convinient but not good as wired earphones.The price/quality of Bluetooth options is way below wired earphones. You will have to go for ANC bluetooth headsets to get decent quality audio experience.I have ordered type c wired earphone to see if it is any better.Overall a good buy for the price. I hope they don't raise price further into Samsung/Apple range.

Think Twice

Batter backup is ok for one day regular (emails, whatsap, upto 1h of phone calls, and few photos). Charging speed is very very fast. It charges from 10% to 100% in 55mins.Overall I am satisfied with the product.Buy official 3D tempered glass from OnePlus, then you wont feel that you have pasted a glass on your phone.

497,3.0 ,"  Battery backup is  poor when compared to1 plus 6. Lasting only for 12 to 14 hours.While attending the call , suddenly hold button or the mute button are getting activated causingcall disruption.While attending a call, automatically it is dialing some other contacts without our attempt. These are some of the difficulties  I am experiencing. Impressed by the performance of the 1 plus 6  (which I was using before this) I went for 7 T. But now I am repenting my decision.

499,5.0 ,"  Oneplus always surpasses expectations as we all know. This phone is build so perfect and beautiful, my iphone user friends are even jealous with the design and make.Pros:# beautifully premium design with glass back and matte but metallic looking glacier finish. I dont like motorised parts like in reno or 7pro design, feel unsafe to me.# processor os ultra fast, finger print reader is fastest i know of, screen is mesmerising though i feel a very little difference as compared to my samsung s7 edge screen, refresh rate i dont know how to make out difference, so no point there tbh.# price rnage is okkay. Not pricey not cheap.# battery life is awesome, considering 90hz refresh rate and samoled display with 855+ processor.# everything else u cna think about is pros only.Cons:# gboard google keyboard is okayish as compared to apple and samsung keyboards, im getting misclicks and misspelled words, accuracy is too much i think, apple has so much optimised keyboards, so does samsung, i think oneplus and google will work on it.# camera performace is just fine in low light tbh, apple 11 will surely shot better pics in low light i think.# i hv watched on youtube about life of back glass, they said it is prone to develop scratches over time, i dont know though, lets see.# headfone jack was removed. My heart broke, its not a good movement, we have senheiser and all 3.5mm headfone jacks, why r u removing these guys, its basic thing, shifting from micro usb to type c usb plug is different thing, but this is not at all fair, we are forced to buy third party connectors which practically ruins the atmos effects, many of us dont like wireless. Thumb down here. As a gesture of goodwill you could provide connector in the box at least, yeah its not there in the box, buy from outside.# no colour option for 256gb version as of now, only glacier blue, not a big issue, but its a bit funky. Not like like for everyone.

It is okI don't know if these problems can be solved by replacingVibration is so smooth that you never come to know that your phone is vibratingPlease everything is tolerable, But phone at this price range and claiming the 8GB RAM must not hang !!Rest all the things are superb with this phone

501,4.0 ,"  Was planning to buy Samsung M30 for my wife. But after reading about lot of issues with the model, went for OnePlus 7T. Double the price, but I'm happy I chose this. No it is not fair to compare the two models but the pathetic quality of M30 with network signal and connectivity issues, it definitely is not worth 14k+Coming back to 7T, there's hardly anything negative noticed after a week of usage. Camera is top notch, low light shots are excellent, battery lasts more than a day even with maximum use of mobile data and WiFi.Will update this review after a month.

"
502,4.0 ,"  Ordered the product on the first day of its launch... I don't know if it's just me, but the phone keeps on hanging in between... It's been a week since I'm using it and it's frozen atleast 5-6 times already.Sometimes, there are issues with finger recognition too... Seems like some quality defect or what.. even the battery doesn't last for that long. I uogarded myself from one plus 5 to this, but Im not impressed with battery life. The only good thing is camera.

503,5.0 ,"  My previous phone, iPhone 6s but i need change due to storage more trouble... I get plenty of review from OnePlus 7t at every where !!! Phone was really great.Snapdragon processor performing very well and osm tooCamera quality was really great !

506,3.0 ,"  I ordered this product on Wednesday 23rd October and received by me on 26th October. This phone looks good now. It drain battery after rough use of 3 hours but thanks to the quick charger, it's bumps the battery level to from 30% to 85% within 25 minutes.I would be possible posting more reviews after using it for atleast 10 days.One issue is i could not find the tampered glass which fits it correctly.The phone should be handled carefully since it has 6+ inches of screen.Display looks so good.Camera is awesome and captures best quality of photos.

"
509,4.0 ,"  Finish of the phone itself feels luxurious and well built.. Only issue is that it heats up while using the camera, maybe this can be fixed via ota updates in the future. As of now 2 days of usage phone is quite stable and works just like a oneplus should.. Only bummer was Amazon's logistics this time was poor my phone box was damaged a bit here and there, thankfully the phone survived..I've xperienced this for the first time and i hope the last..

Camera, performance, display everything is up to the mark. Build quality is quite good and in hand feels quite premium.Dolby Atmos speakers is another plus point. It's true Dolby Atmos feeling while listening. Camera is very impressive both indoor and outdoor it takes decent pictures. 4k recording is super cool and EIS and OIS makes video shooting experience more enhanced.90hz refresh rate of screen feels true amoled smoothness. Gaming performance is extremely smooth. No lag and heating found while playing COD mobile on extream settings.Last but not least, charging is super fast so no need to worry about battery drain. I recommend to them those want to upgrade from old device. Thank you.

516,5.0 ,"  My 2nd OnePlus phone ❤️ Camera Awesome. Battery will last a day. Since I use it for gaming it doesn't drain much. Go for it guys. High end phone  under 40k, don't waste it on some other brand. Used OnePlus 5t for 2 year not even single issue in it. But only thing is they won't give type-c to 3.5mm jack converter. You need to buy it separately from OnePlus website.

"
517,5.0 ,"  One plus 7t is super awesome... Unbeatable experience... Camera quality is Just wow... Just one minus point is the battery, for such a High performing mobile they should have given a battery with a longer life, but it can be managed sonce they have provided with the warp charger which charges the mobile in less than an hour

"
518,5.0 ,"  Love the all-round experience of this beast of a phone. This is my third OnePlus phone in the last 3.5 years, and I wouldn't deny that they always exceed the expectations of the users. Fingerprint reader is a bit meh (doesn't recognize at times), but you can make do with it. Camera quality is REALLY GOOD. I use my OnePlus 7T on 90Hz always (yes, I am addicted to that smooooth experience) and yet the battery works like a charm for me. At the end of my day of moderate usage, I still have at least 40% juice left, which is commendable (considering 90Hz). All in all, I'm totally delighted to use this phone!

"
519,5.0 ,"  Well its a down to earth honest review of OnePlus 7T after using it for one month. First thing this phone is made for single guys like me as it says ""Never Settle"" well just kidding. I replaced my old Samsung Galaxy A30 and decided to go for OnePlus for the first time. Well it paid off superbly. It is a real flagship killer at this price range and it makes Iphone and Samsung look bad to some extent. Coming to the performance its blazing fast with that sweet Qualcomm Snapdragon 855+ processor and 8GB of ram. The fingerprint scanner is also super fast and well designed too. The fluid AMOLED display with 90 Hz refresh rate was something that the OnePlus first introduced it in the market and rest all other smartphone company just followed along the standards set by OnePlus on its flagship device. With 1 month of usage I found the following important pros:-1) Blazing fast - do not worry about lags anymore.2) Network connectivity with this phone is also superb as OnePlus claims it is due to the new processor that results in 15% faster network acquisition. Downloads are blazing fast on Airtel 4G3)Oxygen OS v10 based on stock android 10 - the OS is clean with less junk and far better in performance than other OS by respective companies like MIUI, OneUI etc.4)90 Hz Fluid AMOLED display with FHD+ resolution of 2400 X 1080 - Videos and games feel ever so smooth.5) Gaming - its not a gaming centric phone by any extent like Asus ROG 2 but gets the job done and has even higher benchmark performance score than the ROG 2. The Adreno 640 GPU can handle the games at pretty high graphics setting @60 fps too.6) The feature of Gestures makes life a hell lot of easier for me.7) The UFS storage 3.0 makes copy and paste operations much more smoother and faster.8) The 30T warp charger is just amazing. 0 to 70% in 30 mins and 0 to 100% in 50 mins.Every smartphone however great will always have some cons these are:-1)No 3.5mm headphone jack - OnePlus deliberality does this to cut costs so that it can pack up the phone on other features.2) No SD card slot - when u have the UFS Storage 3.0 you dont really need a SD card slot. OnePlus claims it slows down the phone.3) Battery - well larger battery doesn't always mean more screen time as seen in Google Pixel or even Iphone where battery is not very big but they have great power backup and screen time. Same is with OnePlus 3800 mAh can get the job done in most number of days but still feels a bit less when you are performing GPU intensive stuff for a long time like gaming.4) Camera - the only thing this phone lags behind as compared to other smartphones in the same price range is the camera. OnePlus has failed to impress me with the Camera on this phone. At this price range they are only giving EIS and 2x zoom with only a 16MP front selfie camera. While taking broad daylight photos you may notice that the colour may be oversaturated to some extent( a red flower may appear pink in photos). Low light photos at night look superb though. If you are looking for a better camera phone then OnePlus 7T may not be your choice.5) Notch design - Some people may like it some may not its your own personal preference. I personally do not like it because it obscures the display of some apps and videos.6) No official IP rating :- well you are never sure when the phone may give up when it is exposed to water as there is no official IP rating. So use it carefully in rainy season especially. OnePlus says its next smartphones will all have official IP rating.

"
520,3.0 ,"  Finger print reader is not that great. It takes turns to detect sometimes.Battery life is ok. Under 90 Hz Screen Refresh Rate, I m getting one and half day battery life. I don't play any games. No social media, too. Just normal usage. OnePlus should increase battery strength.Camera is awesome. Screen AMOLED display is very good. Android 10 has many options to use. Great speakers too.

"
521,4.0 ,"  First time OnePlus user. Previously used Xiami, Nokia, Samsung, Motorola etc. This phone is blazing fast compared to all previous makes. Fingerprint reader super fast. Camera good. Battery lasts a day with average usage. I got about 60 % charging in 30minutes as against advertised 70%. Battery mAh could have seen some improvement. All in all a lovely top notch product. Will review in few months of usage if issues found.

"
523,5.0 ,"  For someone who upgraded from an Android 7.0 phone, the OnePlus 7T is a sea change.After watching innumerable reviews & comparisons between the 7T & 7T Pro, i finally settled in on the 7T as it's a VFM product & the 14 K premium that the 7T Pro commands doesn't seem worth it for what it offers IMHO.It's been a week since I am using it, the display, the finger print scanner and the face unlock all works blazing fast, including the charging. The battery lasts about a day for my moderate to heavy usage which is acceptable. Yes, there are better battery phones out there but the fast charging makes up for that small gap.Camera is good , however, can't compare it to the iPhones or high end Samsung's.The one feedback i would like to give is to provide a Type C headset in the Box which would have given the customer a feel good factor at this price point.Enough has been written about Oxygen OS and it's indeed worth writing about. There are enough customizations to keep most people happy.All in all, it's been a great start and I look forward to ""Never Settle"" with the OnePlus 7T

"
524,4.0 ,"  The Phone is good but Amazon's delivery is worst. The fingerprint sensor is awesome but you need to update your fingerprint data time to time to get the best experience. The camera quality is good not great. If you are just want good photos just go for it but you will not get those mind blowing photos and the low light performance is good but in nightscape mode you will experience artificial colours and lighting. Battery takes 45-50 mins (approx) for 0-100%. But battery life is not that great and yes you will find a lot of bugs in this phone. The build is fabulous and will feel like a premium phone in hand but as the rear camera is bulging out, it gets scratches. The selfie camera is good not great. The performance of this phone is really great and you will definitely love that 90Hz display but it is not a 4k display. Coming to the point, should you buy it? Yes, definitely if your budget is 40k max and u want something which is really fast and features packed. Comparing it with the realme x2 pro, if u have a tight budget then go for realme or else u should go for it and u will never be disappointed. For gaming purpose- yes this is a great device but for only gaming go for the Asus rog phone 2. For camera purpose- yes this  performs well but not extraordinary. So for camera u can go for iPhone or google pixel. But still then its a great device. The speakers, display, build, camera is worth the price u pay. Yes its overpriced by 4k-5k but still you should go for it. And yes to quote please go for the 256gb variant because the storage is enough to provide you with peace of mind.

"
525,5.0 ,"  About Phone:-The OnePlus 7T improves upon the last-gen version of the handset with a 90Hz refresh rate screen, some camera improvements, and faster charging. There are tons of other minor improvements, and it all makes up for a more refined and reliable overall smartphone. The 7T is an excellent low-cost flagship.For Camera :-Low light quality. Let's start with the main 48MP camera again. Like the daylight images, low light images from the main camera on the OnePlus 7T are good, if not exceptional. ... However, the images are still very well exposed and have good overall dynamic range

"
526,4.0 ,"  Phone is extremely fast, modern looking and looks amazing with the original OP7T sandstone case. Easy to set up and use.However, the dimensions are a little too big and it becomes unwiedly to use. I would rather have a smaller screen with same specs.

"
527,5.0 ,"  Hello dear buyers,I am writing this review after using this product for 6 months.Let's come directly to the point:1. Super fast phone.2. Fingerprint reader and face detection is so fast some time I thought whether I have set any screen lock option or not.3. Camera is too good. Night mode is too good. Some images also attached.4. Video quality is superb.5. Surround sound is too good.6. Phones speaker are really awesome.7. Best part is, after playing game like pubg continuously for 1.5 hour, handset is not getting warm that much that is the thing which I love the most.8. Charging, oh my God, it's too fast.9. Battery back, for a moderate user it will last just above 24 hours and for a heavy user you may need to charge the device twice in 24 hours of time span.10. If you are a moderate user and looking to buy a device which you want to use at least 3 to 4 years then you can go for this product blindly.11. Only one problem so far which I realized that is, it is not possible to buy a costly phone like this every time for a middle class person. As it was my dream to own a OnePlus so I did it. Actually the thing is, this phone is so fast that you are not going to even like any other phones in mid range segment. After using this product I realized that my budget has increased alot for the coming future days. 😊

"
528,5.0 ,"  Still a flagship killer in 2020I choose 7t over 8 because both have many similarities and i would like to go for good bluetooth earphones instead of spending extra money on oneplus 8

"
530,5.0 ,"  I am happy to buy this phone. The UI though misses a few features but it's minimalistic approach and close to stock experience enriches the performance. Camera is at its best. The low is best though it struggles sometime to focus in low light but that would be fixed in the next two or three updates. Talking about performance, it is the best. Do not compare it with ROG Phone II because OnePlus offers great camera and design as well. I was bit disappointed with its battery life. If you've power source then it won't matter because it charges too fast.90Hz display is best. Oxygen OS has nicely optimized Dark Mode as well.I feel Oxygen OS 10 needs more stability right now.

"
531,1.0 ,"  I am first-time oneplue phone buyer.I liked the OS, speed and display.But my phone has an issue with network. Network suddenly drops, either we need restart the device or select and deselect Aeroplane mode.When I asked Amazon for replacement they have asked for factory reset to check the issue. And issue didn't came for few days(till replacement period over).I have visited the OnePlus  service store, they are useless.And many people are facing same issue, I understand when looked into the OnePlus community.Looks like, I have to use the same falty divice till the next phone.

533,4.0 ,"  Reason to like it1. Awesome display 👌 quality punchy colours2.Top class performances ultra smooth experience lage free3.Top class ram manegement4.Superfast Face recognition(but not realibel) and also fast fingerprint sensor.5. Unbelievable charging speed. In 0-72% charge just 30 minutes it's crazy.6. Best class dual speaker and cystel clear sound experience with Dolby Atmos.6.Value for 💰 MoneyReason to dislike1.Battery capacity some little bit extra then this phone bang. But warp charge technology speed maneg it2. Mean reason some people to not buy its....... missing 3.5 mm audio jack. Including im miss this. OnePlus in future please study indian need and do not ditch audio jack.3. And finally 📷 Camera- its not a top class. Means not too bad not good im rating it Good+. But some how i hope this phone camera some improvement then its bang. But its not a impossible.Overall great phone. Dont hassitate if your budget under 35k then buy it. And also some people miss expandebel micro SD card slot. But this phone already inbuilt 128GB internal storage. And in this present time maximum people stream videos, song movie watching and listening in online. And even store your personal data like- photo, contact etc store in cloud server so my thinking inbuilt storeg it's enough for daily useg. If you need extra storage go to 256GB version, but you can also pay 3k rupee extra.Thanks to everyone 😊

534,4.0 ,"  Writing this review after observing for 2weeks. I have bought this as present for my wife and mobile looks elegant and one will fall in love upon looking at it. All these years I have had misconceptions that China made mobiles can never live upto quality that iPhone has. But to my surprise one plus has designed this phone par to iPhone (screen clarity)..features, camera clarity are excellent. However, portrait mode could have been better. And finger print reader fails to recognise at times.. I haven’t explore the mobile and its available features to the core yet..product delivered as it featured here.

"
535,5.0 ,"  It's a beast.OnePlus proves themselves with every product.Unbeatable in every manner.Camera, Performance, ChargingEverything is just like Vow...Quality product.For those who are buying it without thinking about ROG phone 2 will know the power of OnePlus. OnePlus is uncompromising form the beginning.Battery backup:-5 hours screentime on 90 Hertz while playing PubgMobile on HDR Extreme Frame Rate.No lag,But still game is not optimised so may experience just Flickers. Nothing else . Everything Renders even with 8X Scope.So apart form Gaming. This device meets your expectations compared with others and found this.

"
536,3.0 ,"  Just used it today for the first day. Nothing too great. Battery life is average. Charges fast though. Phone heats up very quick. I would say not a good upgrade from the 6T.If you have a 6T you can avoid this one.

"
537,5.0 ,"  Amazing camera quality 😍However, as compared to iPhone X, OnePlus pictures are little color saturated but many of us like it that way.. so it saves time editing pictures and also lot of money unlike apple devices ;)OnePlus 7T camera really surprised me, specially for night and low light photography.It also has a wide angle camera.Great screen size.Comes with screen guard and mobile cover.Dash charging is superb.Totally happy. I should have bought 256GB model though. It's just 2k more than this one which has 128GB.

Lolz. But over all I am very happy with this phone.

542,5.0 ,"  If this phone is in your budgetDo not have second thoughts just go for itI have been using this phone for quite a long time now and I just love its design,screen and everything else.The phone charges in 60 minutes from 0 to 100 and that's just a spec which other phones these days don't provide.Love the Oneplus 7t.

"
543,5.0 ,"  The phone is very snappy. Performance during day to day tasks is super quick and if you come from a mid-range device, you will feel the difference. You can do heavy gaming without any hiccups. I play PUBG a lot and this OP7T plays it without breaking any sweat, btw it supports HDR+Extreme graphics settings (in case any of you is wondering).Besides there is this really high quality vibration motor that gives you a very premium feeling, I mean at first you will think what difference does it make, but trust me once you start using it, it just adds to the overall experience.Camera is really good too, I feel like that I won't need to use GCam on this.Battery is a bit smaller than the norm these days but I am easily getting 5 hours 30 minutes of Screen on time (netflix, YouTube and pubg mainly) which is really good.The overall in hand feel is like a candy, it's quite slim and feels premium but have to be careful and put a case at the back, otherwise the glass at the back may shatter if it falls.

"
544,3.0 ,"  Took The one plus 7t this month, good battery life, good camera , very fast processor. Just one drawback , the voice clarity during making calls is not that clear ! Had the same issue with one plus 6t too, n even the receiver is unable to listen Clearly  while talking ! Hope one plus fixes this issue soon !

"
545,5.0 ,"  I've been a surrounded by iOS. The only android I've used on a daily was way back to the 1st Gen Android Xperia X10i.Decided to switch to Android for functionality and my god it has been the best decision! 7T easily beats most of the devices in terms of practicality. Battery life is a little low but can't complaint because the Warp Charge makes up for it. 90Hz refresh rate makes other phones look primitive. Snapdragon 855 plus can take on any app/game you throw at it and all this superlative performance is backed by a finish that's no less than a ₹70k plus smartphone.In short, Best phone you can buy on the market in Nov'19 period.

"
546,1.0 ,"  Service is really poor. Don’t buy this product. It’s better to go for iPhone, it’s around the same price. Mine was under warranty and it’s screen started flickering, so had raised the complaint. Phone was picked up in perfectly good condition but now they are saying that it was damaged and demanding 12k for the repair. I had showed the phone to the pickup guy, there was not even a scratch. Going to file a consumer complaint against them. Not worth when for the same price you can buy an iPhone.

"
547,5.0 ,"  Great fan of OnePlus and I was user of OnePlus 5t and now upgraded to OnePlus 7T.Actually I was waiting for the 7T since the launch of oneplus 7 because I knew 7T will stand up to the mark. And they proved it..Superb phone with lots of interesting features which will never let you keep your phone down ( so we have zen mode 😋 )

"
548,4.0 ,"  Alright got the device on the third day after ordering it, delivery was amazing. The package was nicely packed and the delivery guy was very polite but it took me around 10-12 calls to connect to him he didn't bother to pick them up otherwise it was fine.Now coming to the main topic = OnePlus 7tEverything is good played pubg for an hour ran smoothly battery drained about 5-6%But the only dislike is camera according to the price I think it could have done a little better than it does nowRest the phone is good.

549,5.0 ,"  My very first one plus experience. OnePlus 7T is the best product available in the market with 855+ fastest processor.The variant i have is glacier blue 8/256gb. It fastest in the segment and the cam specs are perfect for any capturing evey moments. 4k recording with 1080p and photos captured in low light are better.Macro photography and Warp30T do come in handy.Only difference with pro variant of 7T is u get a popup selfie and no other performance changes as the professor is same, so if you can handle the notch then 7T is the best deal you can afford..The back design of pro variant 7/7T are very similar to redmi K20pro where as 7T looks like you got 3 big massive camera lenses and unique design adds fresh feel.Competitors like Redmi/Realme don't even match this beast. OnePlus is allrounder in this segnent.Try to get in exchange offer as that gets you the best price cut for a very premium device.

550,5.0 ,"  Have been using since 8 months, no complain till now.. earlier the apps used to close or crash, the camera s/w did not respond which have been corrected in recent updates. I feel the fingerprint reader is a bit slow compared to other similarly priced phones. Bought this phone only for camera and it dnt dissapoint. Was about to get Iphone 11, but got this one instead.  Overall a good purchase.. did not dissapoint..

"
551,2.0 ,"  Just got my phone yesterday. The speaker quality is very poor. It has some technical issue with collection and transmission of sound. Tried it during several phone calls. When switched to headset Mose it works fine but on changing to loudspeaker, each time there is a problem. Also, when on headset mode, the opposite person's voice can be heard by someone sitting away even with the lowest volume. No privacy of conversations!! Had oneplus3t earlier and thought of upgrading but very disappointed as the basic purpose of the phone is making calls and lots of inconvenience faced during the first day itself.

552,1.0 ,"  So just received my Phone and surprise surprise..cant Set it Up because its already been Set Up for some other Gmail Account. So either User phones are being delivered as new ones or those Testing are forgetting to factory reset. One Plus what say? Spent a miserable day thinking Phone was faulty and then voila...recovery Mode and cleaning all Data and the Phone Set Up easily. Not Tried any Features yet...but this was definitely Not the experience I was looking for.

"
553,5.0 ,"  This phone is ALL that you need! This is by far the best Android smartphone ever and packs powerful features at a good price. The camera, foremost, let's you capture stunning images, has different focal lengths, and has a fast capture rate. Simply amazing. The processor is fast and I mean FAST. The best thing about the phone is it's gaming mode and gaming graphics. Has Dolby Atmos sound which coupled with a high refresh rate delivers an enhanced gaming experience for games like NFS, FIFA, PubG etc. Also, really good charging capacity and battery life. I really like the feel of the phone, I got a blue one.Only con is that it doesn't include a headphone port for 3mm jacks. So one can either purchase a One plus connector or purchase a set of wireless headphones (which is what I did).

"
554,3.0 ,"  Fast processing, fingerprint reader is very fast, charging very fast and easily lasts for a day once full charged. Camera quality is best, even my friends who are using I phone asks for taking photos. FB app is not working good. Found some software problem while using, sometimes display automatically gets white patch, i need to restart the device to solve this problem. I don't know whether this is happening with my phone only or others are also facing the same issue.Oneplus team should solve this issue asap.

"
555,5.0 ,"  I've been using it for a while now. Absolutely f****ing glad i purchased this. It has its cons, but whatever it does well, it does mindblowingly well. So much here that has been done to perfection.Pros:1- Display is so good its unreal. After using 90hz you'll never want to go back to 60 hz again. Infact I find 60hz phones quite unusable now. Colors are awesome too. It's not curved like OnePlus 7 Pro, so it doesn't have the issue of accidental touches and inputs from your palm that curved screens have. On top of that it won't break as easily and curved glass on any accidental falls and It'll also cost a LOT less if you happen to break it than a curved glass would.The brightness is excessive. To the point where there is no need to have it above 75% brightness in any situation, even outdoors. This means even outdoors in sunlight you'll have a good viewing experience and STILL be below the maximum brightness possible in this phone.2- Camera is amazing. Macro shots and nightscape will blow your mind. Wide angle lens does a good job too.3- Oxygen OS is arguably the ONLY version of Android that is better than stock (it's debatable, but I stand by this statement) . The OS is a huge selling point alone.4 - The charging again, blows my mind. I usually don't charge overnight. I wake up, keep it on charge till I take a shower and have my breakfast. When I'm back 45 mins later, it's almost always fully charged. That is absolutely nuts.Cons:1- There is no headphone jack. Although you can buy an adapter for pretty cheap on the oneplus site itself. Still jumping a few extra hoops to use my Earphones is a con for sure. And Bluetooth Earphones just aren't on the same level as wired ones (audio output wise) unless you're willing to shell out upwards of 5k.2- Battery surely isn't nearly as bad as people in the comment section seem to be saying it is. But it's still pretty average. It'll last you the day, but no more than that. This isn't that huge a con bexuase as I said, battery isn't bad, it's just not anything special. And secondly, the warp charge can get half your battery back in 25 mins or so, so the actual capacity means very little when you have that as far as real world usage is concerned.

556,3.0 ,"  Camera is hanging and not responding...initially we thought that we should check for some time before returning the product ...usually return window is opened for 10 days but for this item it has been delivered on 14th....after using 3-4 days, issue is continued so we are thinking to make a replacement but found return window closed on 17th. Why return window was closed in just 3 -4 days.Front camera is frequently hanging...it is surprising that so much ram and processor is not able to Handel the hanging issue....please make a replacement for product.

"
557,2.0 ,"  This is the first phone that is giving me headaches just by looking at it! I mean did i get a defective piece or is OnePlus really that bad? I've seen someone in another review of the phone saying the same thing. How can a device like this move into production and then be sold. You're spreading out health problems via a phone. Don't tell me that I'm the only one with the problem. I've use LG, Samsung and an Iphone and have never faced such an issue. My first purchase of Oneplus and will be my last. Should never have trusted in the first place.

"
558,4.0 ,"  A wonderful upgrade for someone who are using phones like iPhone se/6/7 and one plus 5/5t. Earlier I was using an iPhone SE. I'm writing this review after one week of usage.Pros:• Battery life•Fast charging•flawless display•super fast processor•camera•great gaming performanceCons:• many times I faced software glitches in social media apps• Camera sucks in Snapchat (zoomed and very blurred image clarity by default)•im using a frosted silver model and I'm not really satisfied with the color, which makes it look like an old fashioned phone.Verdict: Really good phone by one plus which offers you 90% of 7 pro features at 38k. I hope all the software glitches and Snapchat camera gets fixed after an update in future.if you're on an higher budget I would suggest you to buy Samsung Galaxy S10 or an iPhone 11 because both of them offer much better camera performance than one plus 7t.

"
559,4.0 ,"  Everything is good either its build quality or oxygen os expect front camera (good one but slightly soft picture) and battery (batery optimisation of oxygen os is the best amomg android but it's little less ~3800mah for a big gorgeous 90hz display). But if you carry a decent powerbank with you in outing then this the best phone within 35k till now.But what strikes the most is its perfomance, it's seemless and buttery smooth even in 60hz refresh rate.Rest is up to you.

"
560,5.0 ,"  What else one could ask for. The Best phone in its category. Cheaper than Flagships. Camera is awesome. Few shortcomings but that's pertaining to Software and platform of the OS.

"
563,5.0 ,"  It's been one month for this purchase and I'm still in love with this phone. Absolutely wonderful camera quality..the picture quality is superb. Amazing battery life despite of so much consumption through the day. I'm used to watching (streaming) a lot of videos and listen to music throughout the day, plus the regular calls, messaging, and other data consumption doesn't exhaust the battery fully. I just charhe my phone once a day and it suffices me for more than 16 hours a day.

564,5.0 ,"  Everything is at its best, except the 90hz screen won't give you 1day charge,And i don't know why but my phone laggs 1 out of 10times in the dialing and contact screens,And last but the most annoying thing is , headphone jack!Believe me that jack connector has nothing more than just a connection extension with a little piece of wire but costs at least 300 rs and go upto 1500 also :D ..I personally bought an local one in 50 rs and it didn't work coz of different config so i cut opened it and resoldered it 🙃. Now its awesome!If headphone jack is so imp to you ? Then be ready to soen some extra cash of no worth 😒 .And one last thing if you are a fan of those oxygen os customizations like in phones like yuphoria , they don't give it now☹️ it's color os now and it's just okay okay.

"
565,4.0 ,"  It lives up to the expectation, screen flawless and smoother than every mobile phone in it's category. Fingerprint reader is faster than OnePlus 7. Wide angle camera is a major boost to the camera set up. Been using it for more than a month now seems like it's gonna last for a long time. Played asphalt and pubg no lagging , super smooth gaming experience. WARP charging is a boon, charges fully in approximately 60 mins or less so no worries for the battery performance. Dual speaker set up adds to the gaming experience. Only drawback that I feel personally is the lack of 3.5 mm earphone jack.

With normal usage easily lasts 1day with 90hz. Got more than 1 day with 60hz display mode.3. Charging is crazy fast. 30 minutes of charging for a day works for me.4. Camera quality is good and macro mode is fun to use. Camera bump is bit ugly though5. Sound quality is good and loud because of the dual front facing speakers.6.

"
573,5.0 ,"  This phone is just awesome. No wonder why OnePlus is gaining popularity so fast. I've to say this is the best phone I've had till now. The camera is just amazing...one which can compete with all the top level flagships like the iPhone X/11, the Samsaung Galaxy S10 and Pixel. Low light photography without using nightsight is itself really good..with nightsight the photos just get thrown at the top end of the spectrum. 90Hz display is out of this world..very smooth experience. RAM management too is done very nicely. The display is awesome. Battery life might seem less for such a powerful phone...but believe me it's a complete beast. I'm easily getting 8-8.5 hours of on screen time..and warp charge just charges the phone to 100% in under an hour. The haptic feedback is really good and software experience is top-notch. Just go for it without giving a second thought.

574,5.0 ,"  ---Usually I buy only the Samsung and apple phones because of the brand value and the apple's environment respectively. But this time i thought i should try out the flagship killer brand and boy i m glad i did. The oxygen OS makes the smooth experience even smoother. The camera is even better as compared to other phones in the same price category.---The SD855+ is one of the performance beast out there....don't even have second thoughts about it....---the battery performance  is good if you are light to medium user. It should easily last you a day. But if you are a heavy user and like to play games and stuff often throughout the day, then the battery may fall short and you might have to plug it in the evening. But yeah, after half an hour, you are good to go.---The haptic feedback while playing games and the display are the best. The 90Hz fluid amoled display makes the whole experience pretty smooth.....---Overall a great buy. If u have a budget of 35k, then go for it....great value for money

It drains 9-10% overnight when the mobile is idle. I'm trying to replace this device, will let you guys know in few days. OnePlus 7t really sucks.

584,5.0 ,"  Superb product.Far far better than Samsung / Redmi(xiomi) / Oppo.I was using Redmi 6 PRO and was planning to buy new phone. I was little bit confused to choose the models. But one of my colleague was using the same model and recommended me to buy the same and conclusion is "" Thanks to my colleague for recommending me honestly to buy this phone""You can blindly go for this phone.

"
585,5.0 ,"  It is really a great phone and worth all your money indeed. Camera is really great but saturation is bit high at times. Battery life not so great but it will last you decent 12hrs depending upon your usage but yes the charger is the greatest asset of this phone. In no time it will charge but you need to carry it everywhere. Overall it's a powerful phone at a decent price. Specs are top of the line without getting into details. 7T has really great specs and superb camera but do not buy OnePlus 7 it doesn't have many features and specs. Invest in 7T.

Every time I restart my device to make it work, I am not sure that is it happening due to a problem with the app or with the device. Otherwise the phone is a must buy.

588,4.0 ,"  Pros :1) Great Battery Life and optimization. It can last for 1 day completely even under heavy usages.(pubg, YouTube videos , music) For Normal usage it can go on for around 2 days.2) Super fast charger. One of the selling point of one plus phones. It juice up the phone form 50% to 100% in mere 30 mins.3) Super smooth display. With 90hz refresh rate you can really see the difference while scrolling through the insta and Facebook pages. It's fast and smooth. I didn't see any significant Battery issues due to 90hz refresh rate so far.4) Camera : great pictures in lightning conditions.5) Last But not the least is Oxygen OS.  4.1) Frequent Updates.  4.2) Cool features. I personally like those customize layout. I am using dark layout with red theme. It looks amazing.Cons :1)Finger print reader. It like on/off sort of situation sometime it work and sometimes it doesn't. May be some software glitch I guess.2) camera performance under dark conditions is above average. Photos looks are on softer side.3) Google keyboard flickering issue in dark mode I am not sure about its related to Google keyboard itself or its software glitch in one plus.4) Heating issue you can feel it around the camera bump.  if you play pubg for around 2 hr or more. But that is acceptable I assume most phones heats up.

589,5.0 ,"  I just wanted a phone for a longer period than my normal which would last for a year or so and due to my usage they will not work after that. But this is seriously a piece of art even though I put it on very tough times it easily handles the work load and does not lag.

599,5.0 ,"  Amazing phone in this price range. OP always does better job and gives head to head competition to flagship phones. No words to say further as u huys already have seen the vedios related to it.The fingerprint is very fast,camera is top notch, having a 90 Hz display the battery life chould have been better if it has a 4500 mAH battery. But 3800 mAH does the job pretty well,plus it is supported by 30T warp charger,so it's not an issue.The power pack performer 855+ is there,with UFS 3.0, so don't think it will have any performance issues.The design and build quality is amazing but should have to use the case for ur own security.And also to mention the delivery by Amazon. It was super fast,they showed the phone will gets delivered within two days ( which is pretty fadt though) but deliverded it within 24 hours. Amazing. Thanks

Camera no doubts is super amazing but outof 100 I would rate this camera as 95 because once you try to focus on an object the side of image gets little out of focus and give a Ray apperance.. maybe I can't describe in words but you'll find many videos regarding that..  but overallScreen 6/5 (Flawless)Camera 4.5/5Battery 4.99/5 (Its totally Subjective)Dash Charge 5/5 (No doubts)On-screen Fingerprint 4.9/5 (Dont ask, its still the fastest but can be rated 5/5)Gaming experience 6/5 (I mean it)Fluency 4.99/5 (It improves everytime there's software update, and you'll find it in any other device. As compared to any other phone, its still maintaining its repute)Personalization 5/5

604,4.0 ,"  Software is very smooth . Stereo speakers delivers good sound but not better than iphone 11 . Face unlock is very fast . Charging is extremely fast . No headphone jack for which you will have to get a 3.5mm connector( around 400Rs ) or a pair of bluetooth earphones . Touch responses are very good . If you are buying it then do check the backlight glitch issue , as there are some customers which faced it and requested a replacement . In my device luckily backlight issue was not there . It happens very rare so don't worry . Haptic motor gives very nice vibrations while typing . Cameras are good but not great than Samsung's or Apple's competitors. Colours look very saturated but you have the option to calibrate the screen according to your preference . 90hz works very well while using heavy softwares or multiple tabs or even intensive gaming . Overall phone is very good and worthy at 35k budget . I don't think the new oneplus nord/x will be better deal than this , let's see . If you have little low budget than it is worth waiting for upcoming X/ Nord .

607,5.0 ,"  Overall impressions of this phone is really good expect this phone to perform buttery smooth and insanely fast. But I found some things really disappointing.1. Battery- Though the battery is a 3800 mAh (li-ion) battery it isn't sufficient (lasts roughly up to 4-6hrs of usage. Plus there is slight heating issue temperature rises all the way up to 42°C and an average of (37-39°C) that's kind of a heating issue for me. OnePlus could've used the traditional li-po batteries providing a range between 5000-6000 mAh battery capacity just like Asus ROG did so that the temperature remains constant.2. Camera bump - the slight camera bump in the back also kind of annoys me because I feel it might get scratched even if I use it with the hard/bumper case.Other than that I really LOVE the phone especially the 90hz refresh rate at this price point is super cool plus OnePlus now are considering to improve their camera through software updates and it keeps getting better :)Thank you OnePlus and Amazon ;)

608,5.0 ,"  Best budget flagship.Camera:-The details are great. The night mode is epic.The macro shot is great to take very small objects with great details. High Dynamic ratios are good.The super stability mode helps to record a shake free video when walking, running or in a vehicle.Display:-Fluid amoled display with 90hz refresh rate is buttery-smooth. The 2400x1080 is great to watch movies and play games. The notch size is reduced which doesn't be a disturbance while watching movies or playing games.Hardware:-Snapdragon 855+, 8gb ram, dolby atmos stereo speakers gives you the best gaming experience.The stereo speakers are really loud and clear.128gb UFS 3.0 is enough for most of the users.Battery:-The battery life is little bit less for power users, but for an average user it stays for a day.The screen on time will be 6-7hrs when used for intense gaming and social media apps.The 30W wrap charge is really fast that saves a lot of time in charging. 30min of charge one full day battery for average users.Security:-The face ID is very fast that opens instantaneously.The in-display fingerprint scanner is also very fast.

609,4.0 ,"  Hi Folks, this is no doubt a good phone. Its snappy fast and swift at handling everyday activities.There are 2 issues though.1. Camera blur control! That is simply not available! Oxygen OS should include that. Gcam helps but, thats about it.2.sound clarity over Bluetooth! Don't get me wrong!Its loud! Its really really good and music is ok. However, bass that deep bass is not good and vocals are not clear. On Spotify, you may get a better experience but on gana its poor.There is something to do with Dolby that you cannot switch off! I am using ath sr30 bt from audio Technica and Mi phones have better sound over Bluetooth!So those are the cons! The fact that it shattered on the bend test is also something one needs to take into account! The massive cutout for the camera us a design flaw Making the glass weak which breaks it!If you can handle it and no blur control is no problem, like the kind of sound it produces...then go for it!Everything else is superb!

"
610,5.0 ,"  The built quality is very premium. The 90hz display gives a very smooth touch experience. Wap charge provides really amazing fast charging. The device gets charged 70% in 30 minutes.  Oneplus is providing 1 year extended warranty if you join the red cable club along with 50gb cloud storage for one year. No hanging; No heating issues. The oxygen OS also has a very premium look, you can customize it.  They are not including any unnecessary (bloatware) software. The only headphone jack is missing.

611,5.0 ,"  Over the last 15 years of using phones, I have spent a good part of my last decade- life & earnings on IPhones.  Except for Iphone 5, I’ve had all models until my last one which was the Iphone 8plus.  There was a brief period when Samsung (S6) grabbed my attention and it served me well, however the bloatware got the best of me before I switched back to IOS.Iphone 8 Plus was with me for over 18 months and the charm had worn off-  it had started slowing down to a point where one could really notice it.  I know,  change the battery, do a factory reset & get another 18 months out of it, but I was just too lazy to do all of that. Spending lots of money on a new Iphone when there was nothing new on offer did not make sense for me.  Specifically, the option of only face unlock and even worse was the speed of unlocking the phone.  After playing around from various phones within friends & family:Enter One plus 7T-Pros:- Premium build & exudes quality.  I got the Blue version- Charging speed-  It’s a miracle!!  ~30% to 100% by the time I finish my shower & breakfast- Speed-  Multi tasking is a joy,  never had a single instance of phone hanging or an app crashing (Side note- Android apps have really become stable from 5 years ago)- Screen is really impressive- Bright, vivid & I love the color saturation (this is a personal choice)- Dual sim-  now I carry just one phone- Connectivity- Wifi & Mobile Network are better than I experienced on my older 8Plus- Camera-  Debatable, they are not the best nor the worst.  Colors can appear unnatural at times.  I prefer Iphone 11 on this one, but much better than Samsung S9 or older Iphones- Customization options are unlimited-  Fancy for me-  In screen Fingerprint scanner - as fast as any normal oneCons:- Battery-  Let’s be clear.  I am a heavy user with office mails synced on phone.  This lasts the work day, but I won’t be confident to go out for tipple after work without a short boost.  But this was the case with my 8 Plus too, except I now need just 15 mins to charge and not an hour like before.  Not a deal breaker for me- Battery-  Update after few days of usage.  Switch to 60hz display, turn off wifi/BT when not in use and it actually lasts much longer.  But 60Hz is not fun once you have used 90Hz- No 3.5 mm, but they could’ve given the convertor- It’s a pain to get tempered glass or back cover from local shops.  Guess this will change soon with more phones coming to the market

"
612,4.0 ,"  Overall a pretty good phone, but I'm not satisfied by its camera performance. Sometimes gets grainy, and wide angle correction is very bad. Battery backup is amazing though. But now since nord is launched now it would be a better value for money if you are ok with less powerful chipset and  no stereo speakers. (7t has Dolby Atmos, nord doesn't even have stereo speakers)

"
613,1.0 ,"  Have purchased above phone and got delivery of the same on 20 th Jan 2020. It worked well for less than 2 months and screen gone blank totally. Customer Service of One Plus over phone could not solve and he asked to visit service station. After spending huge money, DO I supposed to spend time, money and energy to visit service station and get it repaired?? I was not expecting such a bad performance of said One Plus 7T ( So called latest phone) in such a small period.

"
614,4.0 ,"  Battery Life sucks, You hardly get 7 hours of usage. But charging speed is better so you can survive a little bit.Low light camera especially Night mode should have been much better with Triple camera set up but it is a big disappointment.In display fingerprint reader is awesome, so is the refresh rate, but again battery drains a lot if you keep at 90 Hz , so it's enough with 60 Hz ..Ram performance is not upto the mark.Price pont of view it's value for your money.But improvement needed like inbuilt features for Photo and Video editing would have been nice.Camera design not many people are happy with it.Infrared feature is missing so you cannot use it as a remote.

619,4.0 ,"  OnePlus 7T has awesome look and performance. Battery life is ok, average Not too good and not too bad. You will get the updates timely. Camera quality is decent in indoor and excellent in outdoor condition but little sluggish while taking pictures so when you click pictures of your kids it becomes blurry. Otherwise all good. Camera is better than other smart phone who are close to 20k or 25k. You need to set yourself on camera to get better quality. You will never complain about performance, however I will recommend to switch off and switch on once a day for better and consistent performance. Don't use other charger to charge as they are slow and sometimes heat up your phone and can damage. Game performance is also good. Observed normal heating while Pubg which is normal.

"
620,5.0 ,"  It looks good, feels good (thanks to the metallic back - I hate fingerprints) and sounds good (thanks to Dolby Atmos). My first experience with a OnePlus phone, and to say that I am extremely pleased with my purchase would be an understatement.Speed is also extremely high, and the display along with other features make it a joy to use. I find myself looking for excuses to look at it/use it while I'm at work, and I'm fighting a losing battle in that aspect. I've accepted it.I only wish there were better cases for the phone as the transparent one provided with the packaging looks cheap. I mean, it does the job of course, but I would've loved if the phone came with the carbon fibre bumper case instead; as it just looks too good. That, or the red one would've been great.

"
621,4.0 ,"  This smartphone really pleases the eye with its huge screen and excellent display. And it feels fast and fluid too. So everything is there what I would expect from a flagship device in 2019. Two tings I really like on this phone: 1. The parallel apps: I tried it with Twitter and I could set up another Twitter with a different account. Very usefull feature indeed. Unfortunately only some apps are supported: Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp and Twitter (at least only those apps show up in the list of supported apps on my device). 2. Secret drawer in Oneplus launcher. Very handy for hiding certain apps from preying eyes. In my case I put in there all the system apps I can't disable or uninstall :-) But Oneplus 7T is not perfect. There are some annoyances too: 1. The glass back is slippery, so it needs a case on. But the case creates gesture navigation issues: swiping from the bottom screen edge becomes hit and miss because of the elevated case edge which obstructs touches in that particular navigation area. 2. The fingerprint reader is too far down for the thumb ro teach. Pushing the thumb further down, you risk the phone slipping out of your palm. A higher position would have been better. 3. It happens quite often that because of the thin bezels my palm touches the screen unintentionally and triggers something, which annoys a lot. Typing while holding it is sometimes a challenge (I guess this is an issue with all those thin bezels smartphones). So to make it user-friendly I wish my next phone have thicker bezels, please. 4. The phone implements a gesture navigation where swiping from the left or right edges of the screen the previous or the next screen will open. That creates problem when swype-typing words that start with the letters on the far left and right end. It happens often that when I swype-type the words that starts with p the keyboard disappears instead of writing the word on the screen.

622,4.0 ,"  My review after one week of use of OnePlus 7T1. DISPLAY & BUILD QUALITY-Superb AMOLED screen which is very bright, good in sunlight too-90HZ refresh rate is an added bonus. -If you don't mind that notch, all else is good.- The form factor is compact and small, making it easy to hold and operate with one hand.-No Always On display option and No LED notification light.  -The front and back of phone is thankfully not a fingerprint magnet but attracts lots of dust.-Overall design of the phone is very good, except for the camera bump. But the front of the phone looks similar to every other cheap notch-wala phones in the market.-I wish there was water and dust resistance IP rating. -No headphone jack and no earphones in the package. Atleast a 3.5mm converter should be included in the package.-No IR Blaster.2. OPERATING SYSTEM-Latest Oxygen OS 10 and Android 10.... best in class.-OS has lot of customization and is very fluid and easy to use. - Does not come with much bloatware and unwanted apps can be uninstalled.3. CAMERA QUALITY-Both cameras of this phone are really good for daytime.-Low light pics and nightscape mode are hopeless.-Picture processing takes a bit long, especially during night time.-Major problem is the Portrait Mode, which doesn't work properly. I don't see much background blurred. -Wide-angle shots and Macro shots are good.-I don't like the camera bump, but with the cover on, it is not a hindrance.-Some more functionalities and settings in the camera are missing.4.  BATTERY LIFE-3800 MAH battery is quite adequate for about 7 hours of screen time.-The 30T warp charger makes up for the battery issue to some extent as charging happens super quick.-Battery drains faster at 90Hz refresh rate, so i changed it to 60Hz as I am not a gamer.-I found no heating issues with this phone, but gamers or heavy users can tell about that.5. SECURITY-Face unlock and On-screen fingerprint reader are amazingly fast and it unlocks the phone at the blink of an eye.-The best part is the screen lights up at night, so face unlock works like a charm even in a dark room. -Technology here is unmatched, flagship quality but I find the face unlock unreliable as it recognizes my face in the mirror too and unlocks it.POINTERS FOR AMAZON1. Provided me one day delivery for FREE.... thanks Amazon.2. Proper invoice not provided in package or in email.3. Bank offers and discounts made it a sweet deal.POINTS FOR ONEPLUS1. Amazing upgrade to the OnePlus 7 phone, but customers of previous iterations will be disappointed for not waiting for the best model.2. Free two year warranty on phone if you register with OnePlus Care App.3. Very nice quality phone back cover provided in the package.

623,5.0 ,"  Starting with the built quality, it's just beyond my expectations.....just so sturdy an premium......when you hold the phone you could say that's it's one of the best feeling phone in hand.Secondly I would say the cameras are pretty good but the optimization of the processing of the pictures could a bit more good but you could use the Google camera to correct it.Third the whole experience of using the phone in a day to day basis is amazing as oxygen os makes it feel flawless. also the 90hz display is way way smoother than the 60hz which brings to my next point, the battery lifeFourth the battery life is not so good if you are using the 90hz refresh rate but you could easily go to settings and set it to 60hz refresh rate which will help you to drain your battery slower.but due to the charging speed the battery life is isn't a deal breaker for me. Means the 30t charger is so fast that it could charge your phone from 5%-100% in less than an hour which is very convenient for my usage.Fifth the biometrics on this phone is really quick which you will absolutely love. The face I'd is spontaneous, you don't even feel that the phone is scanning your face its feels like unlocking the phone just by pressing the power button. And the talking about the fingerprint it's just enough fast which someone could need.So my final verdict is if you want a budget friendly flagship level phone OnePlus 7t could be your only choice as it feels premium , pubg runs smooth as subway surfer, camera is great, charging technology is just out of the world also has the back support of trusted brand OnePlus if any thing goes wrong.

625,5.0 ,"  Bought this beast 4 days back that is on 30th of May 2020. Yes, this beast gives complex to many 2020 new flagships.Pros:1. Excellent build quality which feels premium to hold and looks classy2. Display quality is top notch in this segment3. Blazing fast processor. There is no lag whatsoever.4. OXygen OS is selling point for One plus devices and rightly so. Such smooth and lovely gestures and clean UI.5. GCam works fine. Stock camera is goo too. I can say that it's not great but good enough to do your job.6. 30watt charger is ice on cake. It makes your task super easy.7. Face unlock in this device has become super fast with new updates. Works amazingly. No complaints. Even in zero light, it works perfectly.Cons:1. Battery life is not that great. Mild uses can last you full day.2. Camera could be improved with software updates. 48 megapixel camera doesn't shoot automatically but you need to go to Pro mode for that.3. Some issues with YouTube videos. Sometimes, it doesn't pinch to zoom. But I am sure it would be corrected with some updates.I couldn't find much cons for now. I am still searching for it.My verdict: Instead of going for one plus 8 which is 8K costlier, go for this device. It gives you extra 2GB of RAM. Camera is same in both the devices.For those who are thinking to go with other brands in this range, just don't. Once try out Oxygen OS and you would fall in love.I shifted from Nokia 6.1 plus and this device is like rocket fast for me.I am loving it.

626,5.0 ,"  Best phone , it's quite remarkable how smooth and easy this phone operates, I've used it for now more than a month and still no lag , no performance issues , now I have become  use to of the gestures by oneplus. Be it the camera department , the smoothness , the speed and performance, of course the 90 hz display is a real thing and you know what , you will feel major difference when using other devices . A bit improvement is needed in battery department but OnePlus has covered it by giving fast charging which is blazing fast, however you can easily run this phone for one whole day if you are a moderate user , say 2-3 hrs of watching videos,  answering calls, taking photos,  etc. I am very satisfied with the product. Moreover I've purchased the 128 gb variant which at that time was of 38000, got 2000 instant discount and exchanged my old phone for 3250 and got it at no cost emi, so it was nice deal.

627,5.0 ,"  Amazing and a power full phone. Camera quality is great, low light photography is also very good. Battery life is decent and depends on your usage. Performance wise simply outstanding. The face detection is so quick, that you will not realise how fast the phone unlocks. The on screen fingerprint reader is also pretty good and quick. But the face detection response time beats everything. Using this phone from about more than a month and very happy to have chosen one plus 7t.

628,5.0 ,"  Surprised at fingerprint unlock speed!Camera: Camera is good, but leaves you wanting for more!At this price point, they should move beyond IMX586 which is available even in 10k phones.Navigation: dual GPS and fast processor together comes in handy to figure directions quickly. Volume rocker slider is useless, they can get rid of it.

633,5.0 ,"  I am giving this review after using my Oneplus 7T for about 15 days. Since now I have not faced any lag issue or app crashing issue. Below are some detailed features I want to mention.#OxygenOS and Fnatic mode : The main advantage of this phone is smoother experience with the 90hz display and Oxygen OS. It runs on the latest Android 10 version. The Gaming mode and the special Fnatic mode is very useful for me. It activats advanced DND mode and blocks calls, notifications, messages and enhances the RAM  , CPU and GPU and also enhances the network speed.#Battery life:The bettery life is not that bad or good, but average. For me as a student it lasts about oneday for a single charge . I can play a full game of PUBG mobile on this divice and it drains only 12-16% battery . But the charging speed with the Wrap 30T is insanely fast. It almost charges my phone from 15% to 80-85% in almost half an hour. If you continuously watch youtube videos , it will give you about 7-8 hour of backup in 90hz , which is great I think. If you want more battery backup you can use it in 60hz.#Camera quality:I don't think i need to say about that. You can check the photos i have taken . The low light mode is awesome.. And a super awesome feature is the supermacro mode. It can focus objects near to the camera of about 2-3 cms. The pro mode is really awesome, which allows you to shoot photos in different ways. I have to still explore the various camera mode options 😅😅. Many people don't like the camera bump and the round camera design. I was also one of them but after using for 5-7 days I am used to it and now I don't feel bad about it.#Sound quality:Sound quality is also good compared to the previous edition (OP 6) of my friend. Now it comes with dynamic sound quality with Dolby Atmos.#Warrenty and updates:Oneplus gives android updates for about 2 years and security patch updates for 3 years . I have got 1 year warrenty . Then i got complementary 1 year warrenty extension by downloading OnePlus care app and registering my IMEI ID no. Overall I got 2 years of warrenty.

634,5.0 ,"  The phone is a great buy for the price.A Flagship killer indeed. Been using it for 4 days. Let me sum up what this phone offered me within this short span of days.1.Speed(snapdragon 855+ and 90hz,it flows... literally)2.Oxygen OS (feels better than Android One if you ask me)3.Warpcharge 30T (0 to 70-80% in 30 mins) compensates for the lower battery.4.The display.(Pretty nice)Some of what i didn't like1.Oversaturated pictures under very bright conditionstaken from camera.Oneplus should enable more picture tweak options in camera settings to compensate for such issues.2.No 960 fps(OP did say it will be released later in an update but the lack of it was a bummer for me)3.The camera bump is not safe even with a case with raised camera lip.The camera circle concerns me when I am holding the phone since there is a chance of the lens getting dirty.

635,5.0 ,"  I'm using it for 25 days.I will talk about its pros and cons.Cons:1. Less battery life than other ships out there...2. Has problem with low light photography.3. Get heats a bit sometimes...but not all the time.4. In hand feel is good but, feels a little havier.Pros:1. The best processor in 35k. 👌2. The best camera👌3. In low light it takes the best photo using the flash 👌4. The Macro lens is a killer !!! The best ever 👌5. Battery performance is decent. If you play games all the time it will still give you a life of 4-5 hours. But in decent daily life use you will deffinately get a battery life of 10-12 hours 👍6. 90 Hz display with 855+ processor is a deadly combination for the smoothest feel while using.7. 30W Warp charger is a beast !!! Charges 50% in just 15-18 minutes!!! 😮So above all the numbers I would like to say that in this prize range Oneplus 7T is the best phone.You might think that 3800 battery won't last long, but I gurantee that with normal daily use you will able to get an all day battery life for sure.Go for it, choose this flagship among all the ships out there a d tou'll realise that its better than a lot of them.I've shared some of my captures in normal and macro lenses  check them out.

639,4.0 ,"  Its been over a month since I've been using this device. My previous phone was oppo f5 and as compared to my previous phone, the performance of OnePlus 7t is at par from my previous phone. I'll better list the pros and cons.Pros:1. Warp charger is terrific with accelerated charging in very less time.2. Amazing camera, but few images that I captured in low light missed details and I'd say that's considerable.3. Sleek design and quite handy.4. Powerful battery.5. Perfect for Pubg Mobile 👌6. Fluid display is awesome.Cons:1. Needs a lot of updates as there are lot of bugs that could mess up with the security features.2. The built is pretty much delicate and couldn't stand drop tests as what I followed in the YouTube videos.3. I particularly faced an issue with Google Chrome in this device. After it hanged as many as 5 to 10 times while using Chrome, I had raised the issue in the OnePlus community and no advances have been made so far.Edit after usage of 1 month. There are few feedbacks:1. I usually hear a weird sound of keypad (like the one that you listen on dialpad) even if I'm not using my phone. This happens quite often and the phone wakes up on its own.2. There's is an issue with my google chrome. Sometimes it doesn't refresh at all the page gets stuck until I close and reopen it again. It actually gets redirected in the background, but not on the foreground while I'm on the page. This goes off when I reopen the app.3. Few patches need to be deployed for camera too.

641,5.0 ,"  Review after using it for 4 months:Pros:1. Display Smooth as Butter.. I think it's the best thing of this Phone.. You can use it all day and It's really really Awesome.2. Speed! 90Hz Display and SD 855+ show it's Muscle here.. From app opening to Gaming, it does everything smoothly!3. Build Quality is Great. It feels Solid. Slightly Heavier Side.4. Warp Charge!! is simply awesome it charging the device within an hour.5. Can shoot video with 4k 30 fps with EIS, 4k 60 fps without EIS.6. Cam2api enabled.Cons:1. No type-C to 3.5 jack in box where it was available with 6T model.2. Battery Backup is not that good, but doesnt matter it has fast charging.3. It's Bulky in hand4. Camera is not up to mark to call Flagship, it is just AVERAGE. It can't even focus on near objects.

642,4.0 ,"  Bought this phone as an upgrade to my iphone 6s and have used it for 2 full months now. And I am thoroughly dissapointed. It might be that the unit I got has issues but thats not going to stop me from writing a review.1. Phone & applications hang/freeze anytime - have to restart it again to continue smooth performance.2. Average camera performance. Night mode is great. But the camera never focuses accurately whenever I switch from wide angle to normal or even macro. Under normal lighting conditions, the primary camera performs well.3. Battery drains quite quicker than expected but yeah thanks to warp charge. 40 minutes and I am back to 100% from 5%.4. Call quality is not up to the mark as the audio is extremely low in terms of volume.5. Stereo speakers are very loud and that's a plus point. However there is inconsistent sound distribution through earphones (I have tried many earphones on this and the observation is constant)OVERALL, extremely disappointed with the phone's camera, performance of applications &

"
643,4.0 ,"  I'll go with what i find it disappointing:# Average battery life.. that is obvious with what it comes with i.e 3800 mah. The fast charging makes up for it. So it's not a problem.# Heating issue with Mobile legend.. i dont play those graphic intensive games like COD or Pubg, but heating up while playing ml, i can't imagine playing those other games.. so often times i'd quit playing ml after 1 or 2 games bcoz of heating issue.# The stock camera: over saturated colours.. the 42 MP main lens is good, it's clear but the software processing isn't good enough.. HDR has improved a lot but not an Iphone level HDR.

(Might be a point of concern for few)Camera quality is superb, specially Super Macro Mode and its Night mode do fab job.Screen is great and super responsive to feather touchBattery life is good with extreme fast charging (Wrap), noticeably faster than Dash Charging.Hope one glitch will be rectified in next update i.e. Some time it stays dumb- no sound or screen notification on receiving a whatsapp message or mail

646,5.0 ,"  I am writing this review after a month of purchasing this device.1. The cameras are good but not great as Apple or Samsung. Well at this price this is better than any other phone.2. Performance - Do I even need to say about the performance? Lol3. Battery - Not great but not bad. Lasts 6hrs a day on heavy medium(my type of usage incl. Gaming, YouTube). But on medium usage can last upto 13 to 15 hrs. Usage may vary*. But thanks to warp charge 30t this beast can charge from 0-70 in 30mins. So that's a major go...4. Display is too good.. that 90Hz redress rate is ming boggling.5. Design wise 7t is a beautiful smartphone. I don't mind the big camera bump. But I would recommend using a case as the phone is way too slippery.This phone has everything I want from a smartphone and I would recommend it to anyone who have a budget of 35000.I only have a small issue comming from a Samsung phone with One Ui is that I really miss that one handed mode. That is the only disappointment and yes also no headphone jack.

"
647,5.0 ,"  The best in the market till date, I'm highly satisfied after almost one month usage.It has the best processing skills, best camera giving excellent shots in day and night and excellent software.I didn't have any problem at all though a lot of people have told about battery draining fast but one thing needs to be mentioned that the battery gets charged very quickly too...You don't need to wait a lot.Overall I'm really going with the phone, one plus 7 pro was an warning for me and thank God I waited for this one..😊

"
649,4.0 ,"  Oneplus has nailed it with specs, they always had a great software, the camera does it's job very well. Plus a fast charger is a bonus. The only disappointment was the battery life. For heavy users, you need to charge at least twice a day, for normal usage it will last a full day. One other small issue, is the camera bump- not sure why they designed the cameras in the circular module. If you can live with these two issues, and have a budget of around 40K, then this is a great choice.

"
650,5.0 ,"  Amazing smartphone. Super fast charger. Battery percentage reached 77% from 15% only in 26 mins. Thanks to Warp charging.The phone is super fast. I noticed a lot of difference from my previous phone (RN5 Pro) when it comes to paying using Paytm.The photos are coming really good.  Especially the photos that are shot in low light. The camera app itself suggests - based on the environment -when we should use the Wide landscape option.The only con is the unavailability of head phone jack. I wish OnePlus had provided the Type-C to 3.5mm adapter in the phone's package. Otherwise it costs ₹390 in Oneplus stores.Just go for it if you're looking for an upgrade. I trust you won't regret.

651,1.0 ,"  Update:So i got a replacement, and the second phone also has the same issue,though a bit less but the tint is now yellowish in the center. I have lost all hopes with OnePlus. Very poor quality control.Even though I have filed for a replacement, I find it important for buyers to be aware of AMOLED Lottery (The fancy name for green tint).As seen in the images, the screen is not Able to reproduce certain colors in brightness levels below 50%, there is a prominent green and pink tint throught the screen.This can be tested by using plain gray wallpaper, dark mode and low brightness during night.OnePlus knows about this issue and will accept the replacement request. It is a lottery, if you get a good screen then you're lucky, if not then please look for this issue in your phone.Interestingly this problem is with a lot of Samsung AMOLED panels. Even OPO 8 has this problem and I'm suspecting Nord might too.I'll update once I get the new phone.

655,3.0 ,"  Although i have heard a lot about the much hyped one plus series, but i found it somehow disappointing; have experienced weird glitches with the phone that left me surprised . To name a few:1. My phone suddenly hanged and the power off , restart and other functions stopped working and i had to drain the battery to get it switched off and on again, however, it didn’t work, ultimately i had to format and reset the phone entirely ; ended up losing quite some data.2. Another time i was watching a series on youtube and the phone heated up quite badly that i had to turn it off for it to cool down.3. The phone hangs sometimes.4. In another incident , the phone hung by itself and all the customised settings were turned off and there were weird malfunctioning tones on its own.I am unsatisfied with this phone, as it was claimed to be so much but these weird glitches made it ‘Not so worthy’.I hope i get a revert from One-Plus , if at all, the read the review

660,5.0 ,"  100% satisfaction with this phone thus far! Love the design, the performance, Oxygen OS, it's a whole lot better than what my previous phone in Samsung was. Doesn't heat up at all, never lags or hangs.With that being said it's early days I'm hoping it stands the test of time and it's only been about a month of usage, but thus far I'm loving every second of it.Battery usage lasts for between 8 and half to 10 hours of screen on time usage and generally lasts for the 24 hours for a heavy user like me. Generally charges from nearly empty to a 100 in a little less than an hour. Charges to 90 in about 50 minutes and to 70 in little over half an hour.Not a huge camera user but from what I have used of it I'm satisfied with it. Phones like Pixel would obviously be better in that department but it wouldn't let you down. This is probably the only area where it's not flagship level. Otherwise it feels premium in almost every other way.

"
661,5.0 ,"  Love the 90hz display. And the cameras have also improved A Lot. Both daylight n night time pics come out great. Good viewing angles on the phone and the sound quality is also superb. Just wish the battery was a tiny bit larger, since it runs out of juice by the end of the day with medium usage. Ofcourse warp charge 3T is great at recharging in about an hour still would have preferred a larger battery if only to avoid anxiety issues towards the end of the day. Overall the best package for the price when you compare both hardware n software. Do Remember to get the One year extended warranty from OnePlus free.

But got too much heat sometime when I play battle royal match in call of duty game.4. Touch response issue is there if you are playing continuously over 2hr.5. Overall Performance is ok. But as per price, performance is very poor. I got better performance in cheap device like realme.6. Battery performance is ok. But not for gamers.7.

666,5.0 ,"  The first question which strikes a common man is what makes this 38k phone different from other phones ranging under 20k. So I've been a Xiaomi user from starting. Under exchange offer I've exchanged Redmi 6 pro with this 7T. This phone has the uttermost best camera you could ever think off. Even in night it takes the best classy pics for you. The performace of this phone is amazing and is upto the mark. Overall you can also use it for vloging as I will be and it shoots the best video for you. Overall it serves all your purpose of GoPro cum DSLR.P.S: It serves the purpose. Individually GoPro and DSLR are better than 7T. But if you are looking for a complete pack in one go for 7T without any doubt.

Anybody who has faced same issues, please help me understand the issue and resolution.

668,3.0 ,"  I am very disappointed by it Although this phone is good at allBut what I find bad is its proximity sensor . It goes on hold and dailed another number automatically while talking on call. Think if your angry boss is talking on other side and phone goes on hold automatically. It my second new replaced one plus 7T. I requested for refund but they assured  me that this problem will not be in new handset. Its my second day of using it. If the problem still goes for 3-4 for days . I will return it.

Screen resolution is too good at 90hz rate more clear than 2240 x 1080p coz i am having second mobile samsung A7 2018 with this resolution and it has much more resolution than oneplus5 and 5t.3. Sound quality of speakers is awesome it give u sound from both speakers. Speakers near charging point and speaker within receiver.4. Best for Macro shots with deeper details of image.5. Screen and running of apps is very much smoother no doubt about that its one plus brand with 855+processor.6. Camera quality far better Oppo,vivo, Redmi of this segment phone coz i checked my friends phones camers in this price segment7. Playing games on 90hz is sharper and smoother8. WARP charger is too speed just in 20 mints  from 15 % to 85% amazingly fast.Cons1. On being delivery  apps and phone configraution  are not opening then i call amazon customer care for settings, then it opens.2 On delivery of phone, it needs to be update coz i can't take my normal video calls and after update i works fine.3. Phone is just bit heavier in this flagship ranger of other mobiles, can't say too much just bit. If you looking for smoother working then this weight issue dosent matter, i upgraded from one plus5 to oneplus 7t so i feel that much4. 3.5mm headphones audio jack point is missing there  and  also not having headphones in box.Rest if you are gamelover then this beast is for you coz running on 90hz dispaly resolution it will give u smoother experince.If u like my review do hit the like button

671,5.0 ,"  Overall rating from my perspective is about 5 start after using this beast for whole one day.Below observations been observed as:1. Overall device come with mind boggling screen refresh rate of 90Hz, and performance.2.  Battery can drain quickly if phone is being used with 90Hz refresh rate, but can manage with battery optimization. But this problem effectively handled with WARP Charge 30 charger (believe me its FAST.)3. Oxygen OS is love. Come with no bloatware. Feels like stock android. Very FAST due to its best OS optimizations.4. Nice animations and customization to use.5. Display is also of good quality and has few options to set ambient display colors.6.  Speakers are of really flagship quality and its very loud and clear. No need to use headphones while watching movie or playing game. I think its because of there no HEADPHONE JACK and OnePlus has logically implemented this kind of speakers to compensate HEADPHONE JACK omission.7. Comes with SD-855+ processor. Obviously no need to discuss this point.8. Good camera (Could have been best, but a big OKAY for me. But that camera bump, I didn't like it at all).9. No issue with Bluetooth connectivity and Wi-Fi.10. Large and clear sound while calling. No call drops.11. Red Cable and OnePlus community is something to know whats going on with OnePlus (Specially I like these communities).12. I love unboxing feeling of OnePlus 7T. Loves those stickers and invitation card from Pete (CEO of OnePlus).13. Its TPU phone case is also of good quality and can be used for few months. It covers edges very well and camera bump as well. (If you can spent RS.1300 buck to get carbon case, go for it.)14. Fingerprint scanner is insane fast and those animations comes in customization are quirky and looks something new.15. Face unlock is also insane quick. I tried it in light and low light, it works so fast.

672,1.0 ,"  It has been a month since I bought One plus 7t... And I'm unsatisfied Right of the bat..  it seems the phone is very fragile and would not handle even a slight mishap.. which let's face it is unavoidable. I had Minor accident and dropped phone from a distance of 2 feet.. now of course this is not the first time I dropped I know the extent of damage it causes when you drop a phone and from what height I did not expect the damage to this level.. half the screen blacked out...dead pixels rendering the phone unusable within a matter of hour.. I should add that the phone was PROTECTED WITH CASE and guerilla glass... When I called OnePlus office for warranty/guarantee of course The damage was not covered bcoz it was an accident and not manufacturing defect.. so to have to put in additional 16,000 rs to replace a month old screen seems very unfair... The welcome to OnePlus world is not really that great..

"
673,1.0 ,"  I bought this phone a month back with lot of expectations and enthusiasm since I already owned OnePlus 3 and was very happy with the phone. But all that enthusiasm and expectations died down within 3 weeks, since my screen got damaged in an unusual way. The phone offers 90Hz Refresh rate with a very good display but at the cost of a risky design. I see this as a design / manufacturing issue which one plus is not ready to accept.The worst part is the Customer Support team and Servify (One Plus Care team) teams who are very unprofessional and change their stance every minute. I was initially told that the screen will be replaced since it was just 3 weeks after purchase. Later I was told to purchase a 1 year Accidental protection plan which I did at additional cost. After purchasing this plan they said, I will not be covered for various reasons and the plan will be no more valid. I had to wait for one week with multiple calls and then shell out 12,000/- Rs from my pocket to get the screen replaced. The Ad says Screen Protection (Pre-filled)...god only knows what this means. I am duped really with the worst customer service team of One plus.Yes while the phone is very attractive with lot of great features...do not forget the quote ""All that glitters is not Gold"". Keep this in mind before you shell out 35+ k to buy this phone.My only hope now is Amazon since I have reported the issue to them and hope they will do something to reduce the pain I went through.

"
674,5.0 ,"  The phone is an absolute pleasure in your hands. The look is splendid.  Silver Matt back finish with mirror finish on the curves gives the classy looks it deserves. Have been using it since the last 4 days and here is a quick analysis:1. Processor is really fast. You can easily notice it as you flip between the apps2. Face recognition is super quick. At times before u even manage to put ya thumb for finger scanning the phone gets unlocked. Face recognition even in low lights is pretty impressive.3. The camera precision is brilliant. One can take stunning pics and with portrait mode on the selfie too makes it even better. Have not tested long distance and night pics so cannot comment on that as of now.4. Game mode is really cool if you are a gaming person which I am.5. The display is really bright and vibrant. You can easily feel the difference from the earlier phone that you were using6. Battery life is really excellent. I spend a lot of time on calls during office hrs and game while free time. But the battery really fights out time easily. Also the quick charge is super awesome. It barely takes like an hour for 100% battery. Just plug in for 15 mins and you can easily charge the battery good 40%.7. The phone comes with a soft transparent case so you need not bother with the drops.8. Loads of inbuilt features that will only add to the delight once you start exploring them.Bad pointJust that the charging cable is round instead of the flat cable which is not that simple to twirl and lock. Flat cable was a lot simpler. Also the cable length is standard1 mtr. I would have preferred if they gave 3 mts.

Yes there are Battery and Heating issues but still it does the job.Battery issue: it can be sorterd out by charging phone in off condition and allow it to drain upto 3%, switch off the phone and charge fully.

In less than 40 to 45 mins, it will hit 0% to 100%# 90 Hz refresh is lightning fast and smooth.# Pretty good in-display fingerprint sensor.# Needless to say, this is the best phone for PUBG, COD and other high-end games.Cons:# Battery backup might let you down, with 3800 mAH battery it lasts only 15 to 18 hours with moderate usage. If you play games expect it to drain sooner.# No headset in the box, which could be a disappointment for the first time OnePlus users.# And this phone have USB type C port for earphones, which is not quite uncommon though.Having these minor hiccups, hands down this is certainly the best premium phone in the market at this price range. Undoubtedly 5 out of 5 from me.

Snapdragon 855""+"" chip set.. All new 90hz display. Wide screen. Etc etcCamera quality well the images do come original when compared to other ones especially the all new developed macro mode. Super cool. But I still find a room for improvisation here & there.Hmm to say about battery.. that's where I can say one plus should have improved a bit. It's like we all have good fruits in hand but unfortunately the fridge isn't working properly 😁😁 something like that..3.8k mAh battery do support you as a nominal use but I say if we are into  games or internet (heavy usage) it starts draining.For a normal usage it dies to 1.5.

684,3.0 ,"  I got this phone on the 2nd of Jan-2020. However, I started using it only since 12th Jan-2020 since I was travelling to another country. On the 2nd day of usage itself, the phone all of a sudden became dead( just a while it had around 30% battery, so it wasnt a off due to battery). Tried to re-start, even connected the charger for around 40 minutes, however there was no activity on the phone( no LEDs and the phone wasn't booting up, even no messages). After many tries, I kept the phone as it is. I did some research and found many users complaining about similar issues( seems some issue with the phone motherboard). On the next day, tried to power on and then it gave a message that the phone was too low on battery. After charging , it then booted up. So, am gravely worried if this issue comes up again(looks like some internal phone issue) on such a premium phone. I am keeping my fingers crossed for now.  I was hoping for a better experience from a OnePlus phone, but my initial experience isnt GOOD. Since I am out of town, I didnt explore the option to returning the phone back. Hoping to hear from Oneplus about this issue and my future course of action if such an issue occurs again.

685,5.0 ,"  I've been using the phone for a month and half now and my experience has been great. I'll list below the few pros and cons that I found while using the phone. I used to have second thoughts about buy a notched phone cus I thought the notch would annoy me, but after getting this phone I hardly notice the notch thanks to the amoled and deep blacks, in a dark room the notch is completely invisible.Pros1. 90hz amoled display is amazing, once you go 90hz there's no turning back to 60hz2. The phone weight is distributed equally and hence its comfortable for one had use for a long period of time3. The stereo speaker setup is better than expected4. RAM boost technology actually works well, I see the apps I use often open up faster.5. Not much of a camera user, but the sample pics I've taken have come out well6. Fingerprint reader is fast, takes longer to unlock after a bath, wrinkly fingersCons.1. 3.5mm to C converter not provided in the box2. The battery capacity could have been increased although using it in 60hz gives better battery life. But I don't think anyone is gonna do that :)

686,4.0 ,"  Look vise phone is good...camera is also good...working also fast.The main disadvantages is battery....is poorIf u are aheavy user ..than battery is not good last only 10 hrs backup...but thanks to  warp 30 charger it charge mobile 0 to 100 in just 40 minCharging speed is very good 5 out of 5 for charger..Price is high for this phone...27k is enough for the phone.

"
687,1.0 ,"  The one plus 7t which I ordered arrived yesterday, the phone does not start it's always on the reboot fastboot ver 2 option, I have tried everything even called Amazon and OnePlus nothing is working, you must check the product before selling please. I am returning the product and buying it again please check that it is fully functioning. This type of service wasn't expected from darshita electronics and Amazon

688,5.0 ,"  They say ""good things come in small packages"", and most rightly so, this product does full justice to this adage.1. Resolution and Screen Quality is top notch.2. Fingerrprint Reader is awesome and extremely responsive and fast3. Camera Quality is one of the bestin the One Plus line up. Macro mode is an icing on the cake,4. 90Hz Display is not a feature but an experience which you will only feel once you use the app drawer  and the OS5. Oxygen OS -android 10 -out of the box with regular updates .6. No lags , No stutters.7. Awesome RAM management and fluid app switches.8. Ergonomics of the phone has been improved as compared to 79. OK Battery backup. Nothing great but charging is super fast10. WARP CHARGE 30T technology which juices up the phone is less than an hour.11. Loud stereo sound and perfect for audiophiles12.Type C usb and 256 gb internal storage.13. The back panel is smoother than a baby's bum.CONS_1. Hideous camera design. This is subjective though. They could have kept a horizontal or vertical module. But i got no complaints since i got used to it and the camera quality is quite a stunner. Please dont expect IPHONE results - each brand has its own strengths and weaknesses.2. This phone is perfect for gaming as well but then you would have to put it on charge because the battery backup isnt like the ROG series. But i aint a gamer so i dont care.3. No headphone jack. Type C usb , so only one charging port to be shared with type c earphones. Additonal kharcha if u dont own one.4.FHD+ AND NOT QHD PANEL - WHY ONE PLUS WHY?5. Gorilla Glass 5 and not 6 - this is sheer cost cutting.All in all - if i dont nitpick , i am very satisfied with this device. Its a beast and a perfect phone for mid to heav usage. This phone has removed all the flaws of its predecessors ,esp the large notch of the one plus 7 and stupid depth sensor and one additonal camera.GO FOR IT BLINDLY.A

Die tonrecent flashes in the screen, we wanted tonreplace this with a flagship Qualcomm phone. Though op8 was on sale, apart from snap 856/855+ there hardly seemed to be any upgrade on the op8. He is in love with the Op UI and hence he wanted a OP device only.....finally decided to get op7T.....great phone. Everything is good....it's an upgrade if you're using Op6/6T.....it's smoother...haptic feedback is great....camera is better.....only 1 con : size wise what about a 6"" screen size.....

690,5.0 ,"  best phone under 40k, there is no better brand and in my opinion 7T for 38k is much better than 8 for 50k (256gb). The phone is just amazing it has everything you will ever need in a phone (except for wireless charging which i dont use). Good seller and fast delivery also 👍

692,3.0 ,"  Okay okay . I am using one plus devices from last so many years. I had used OnePlus 1, X, 2, 3, 3T, 5, 6 & 7T however I am extremely disappointed with the 7T. Camera quality is poor and the price (40k) which I had pay for 8GB 256GB variant. Doesn't justify it. As of today's I don't recommend any one to go for a OnePlus devices anymore.1+devices are not worthed anymore. It's better to for a flagship devices or go for other brands cheap mobile but no more 1+

"
693,2.0 ,"  Not value for money phone!!We heard lot about One plus brand so thought of replacing I phone X with this. Expectations were definitely high!!Phone doesn’t have image stabiliser so no point in providing high res camera. Sound quality is pathetic. It will ruin your music listening abilities.If some one wants to spend 40k then one should definitely look out for I phone x.

"
694,5.0 ,"  So I have been using this device from the last 24 hours and let me tell you, some people have been writing bad reviews about this phone dying that the phone feels like a block in the hand and the camera quality is not good, please DO NOT listen to their reviews as these people clearly don't know how to click photos or are just expecting performance of the camera that a lakh rupee phone offersBattery is a little less but it does not matter,the image quality is amazing and please do not listen to those youtubers comparisons as they have been using apple phones and samsung flagship phones and just don't want to appreciate the phone and companyFor the end I m just gonna say that the phone is amazing and the camera quality is good as well,ps you should know how to click good photos if u want the same results as an apple flagship phone

"
695,3.0 ,"  I have used I phones since last 4years and yes it has low battery life but its really a good product . I went for one plus because of the rom ,ram ,screen size and battery life and obv budget . It works smoothly , good screen refresh rate ,good battery life and yes fast charging but it lacks in so many things .1. Image editing . If you try to write a text on image in its inbuilt app the text will go blur . Same problem is in uploading stories on whatsapp and Instagram .I spent a lot of time on social media uploading and posting and stuff and one plus really creates a lot of nuisance.2. Instead of natural colors it brightens the color contrast just like any other low quality Android .So if you are a blogger or like clicking a lot of pictures and use a lot of social media plz go for Iphone .Only plus point .I also play games on my one plus and it runs like water even smoother than that .So if you are looking for a gaming device this is where you go to but if not for gaming buy something else .I hope this review will help you .

699,4.0 ,"  Below are the issues listed after 10 days of usage:1. This is a performance phone absolutely no doubt about it but it isn't delivering the top notch performance, it takes around 2-3 seconds to load just after restart.2. Caller picture is getting blurred. I tried with some third party apps also but the issue still exists with some caller. But when I set caller picture  for any contact with phone's default caller picture feature, I'm still getting blurred image when I call someone.3. Sometimes (let's say 2 out of 10 times) when connected with Bluetooth headset the sound output flickers, when phone is locked. Works fine when phone is unlocked. However, it get resolved while I disconnect the device and reconnect.4. Sometimes I feel heating issues with this phone (I'm not a PUBG guy, I don't play heavy games on phone). With normal usage, I feel heating issues. However, occurrence frequency of this issue is very low.5. Sometimes I don't see music navigation layout when phone is locked. I have to restart the device, then able to see the navigation buttons on lock screen.I'll reach out to One Plus service center and hope they'll resolve it.Overall this is a good choice within 40k bracket,  AMOLED + 90Hz display is awesome. Camera in daylight is great. Haven't tested the supermicro shots. Nightmode picture quality lies between good to very good (very good excluded).Thanks,A satisfied One Plus user (If they resolve the above mentioned issues😃 )

"
700,5.0 ,"  Camera is nice and the phone overall performs very fluid and is a beast at multitasking and gamingFeels premium and classy.Only downside i see is lack of a headphone jack, which could be sorted with an adapter ie usb c to 3.5 or to 3.5 and usb c.Also, the case in the box is very premium... In case if this is imp to you.Audio quality through speakers and headphones is great.Lemme know anything specific you want to know :)

704,1.0 ,"  Hi there,I received my order of OnePlus 7t on 17th June, which started giving me trouble from 19th June. Phone hangs in between while using apps and then don't even allow me to do anything. I have to literally wait till it's battery is drained off so that it can get rebooted.I shared this complain with customers service and they schedule an appointment for 23rd June. I got technician details, however on 23rd June I didn't get any call or notification from anyone to check my phone.Later I received an mail saying I wasn't reachable.So, I again rescheduled my Appointment to Friday i.e. 26th June.Again, I got all the technical details but on the day no one contacted me for testing my mobile.And today I got a mail saying my Mobile has been checked.How is that even possible?!This is outrageous!!And now want to replace this product because I already waited for long enough.Also, please escalate this.

"
705,1.0 ,"  The phone is overall good no doubt.But the phone they sent me was a defective piece.It has some green tint issues on the displayWhen the brightness is 10-40% the downside of the display gets this green hue and it looks green and dull while watching netflix and playing anything.Also there is this black crush issues too.Until I found this the return period was finished and now i don't know how to resolve.

708,5.0 ,"  Well yes, battery is something to worry about. But you got fast 30 watt charger. Still if you are a normal user, it works for whole lonv day easily. Personally, i loved the back camera looks than the standard vertical adjustment. The camera quality is amazing.The screen is flawless. The 90hz feature is just next level.Have smooth gaming experience.Really happy and satisfied buyer.

709,4.0 ,"  Finally almost most 8 months I'm writing review..this is my first android after iphone I thought I won't like it but hey the OnePlus surprised me.Best display, fast charging, Dolby sound...But only one thing is battery draining too fast I have to charge two times ... I'm using 90hz display though..so ok but could be better

"
710,4.0 ,"  The phone performances is awesome. Someone can only compain about its battery life. Battery can only survive 4-5 hours on continued usage. About the camera, it's not great in this price, but it's quite quite powerful. Display refresh mind blowing. Over all 4 stars for this mobile

"
711,5.0 ,"  First of all mention that some people are getting poor battery including me for few days, but after 3-4 cycles of charging poor battery became excellent. So please don't post the reviews without giving phone proper use time.I love my haptic vibrator, due to that I want to tyyyyyype more on the keyboard.Screen colour reproduction is excellent 🤩,on par with Samsung and even better in some areas(read Android authority review about screen). And 90 hz don't read about it ,experience itDual speakers are awesome 😍Cameras are miles ahead than my previous OnePlus 5, that's enough for meAndroid 10 gestures are awesome (copy from iPhone gestures)Light blue colour is excellent in person which was average in images.When I waited for my phone to charge🙄,it was that fast and cool.Once go to OnePlus you will never comeback. It's not about features,it's about experience.

712,5.0 ,"  I am using oneplus products since the launch of oneplus one and till now used 5 oneplus models. Never faced any issue with any phone even after 5 years my oneplus one is still working.Now come to the 7T, I am using this phone for the last 4 days and really happy with the performance, oneplus always used a top-notch processor with 8Gb Ram and Oxygen OS just make everything flawless. This 90MHz screen on oneplus is the reason to opt for this device you can clearly see the difference in your device screen and oneplus 7T screen every single Fram is fast and smooth on this screen. Now they also improved sound quality with Dolby sound, I was using 6T and it is a very huge improvement in sound quality. Now come to the camera yes camera is very good at 7T but do not expect quality like iPhone and pixel, 7T camera can take very good shot and the way they give us the freedom to use the combination of three lenses is very useful I love this quick toggle between lense. The battery is decent for me, I am a heavy use with all the time internet on easily getting 1 and half day battery and wrap charger is cherry on top this is the fastest oneplus charger only tool 45 minutes to charge phone from 20 to 100. If you really want a practical phone with the fastest Hardware and software just go for it, no need to think twice.PS: I haven't checked gaming performance but I know this phone has the power to handle any kind of game.

714,5.0 ,"  Buy it and don't think twice: The OnePlus 7T is the new Android phone to beat for the money, with a peerless, 90Hz display, excellent performance from the speediest CPU on the market, and a lightning-fast-charging battery. The camera isn't the nicest you can buy, though it's more than competent for the price

715,5.0 ,"  I have always been a OnePlus user since 2015 when I had my first OnePlus 2 phone. So, this OnePlus 7T seems a wonderful upgrade to me after all these years. The big screen is a delight to use. Camera quality and features are excellent and phone is super fast with the huge storage and RAM. Face unlock, fingerprint reader both work like a charm. Warp charging is fast and charges up the phone quickly. I would recommend this phone which has all the best features and design and at a good price range compared to other Samsungs and Apples.. Go for it! I got mine at 26k instead of 35k as I used my pending vouchers so it was a steal deal for me. 😉

"
716,5.0 ,"  Completely satisfied with the device built quality, no offence to camera bump haters, personal preferences.My main reasons to buy OnePlus 7T over 7Pro would be for 90Hz screen panel, dual stereo audio speakers, macro camera lens, faster then ever charging speed and improved efficiency in phone handling ergonomics in everyday use.All of it at this price point, OnePlus has accomplished a perfect and powerful device for average everyday user.Received this product in less than 30hrs, faster then ever, thanks to Amazon.

All most all photos are blur.3. Red eye removal feature is not present. If u click somone camera using flash, then in photos persons will be having Red eye.Other things are good about this phone including performance, battery backup.One star less for camera.

720,4.0 ,"  As everyone know, it's an amazing mobile. Smooth touch, fingerprint reader is wow, battery life, I can say okay, but warp charging is superb.Things I don't like is camera, it process the photo and saves the photo of 2-4Mb max, if not clicking on pro or raw. As a photographer, I m not satisfied with the quality.Gaming wow.

"
721,4.0 ,"  I am using this handset for last 1 month. But i am facing some issue with the earpiece and the mic. Sometimes the  other person doesn't hear my voice.Otherwise the handset is awesome but comparitively heavier than my old Samsung Galaxy S7 edge. I have been using premium mobile phones for a long time, it feels less premium (that's personal opinion). Build quality is solid. Amazon's delivery is lightning fast. By and large the One Plus 7T is awesome.

"
722,5.0 ,"  First of all thanks to Amazon for there quick delivery within 24 hours along with exiciting exchange offers. Thank you Amazon!The product was delivered in a unique sealed tamper proof bag with a unique ID for your security.Coming back to the product, it's a swashbuckling deal adding all the discounts along with exchange price at just ₹31700!Pros:1. 3 rear cameras with 1 being the main camera, other two for wide angle and close up shots. You will enjoy photography at night (low light) photography too with this device.2. 90hz refresh rate with fluid amoled display.3. 855+ processor makes the device buttery smooth.4. Inbuilt ram boost management.5. Fast face unlock6. Comes with protective case with cushioned corners that protects your screen even if it drops from 2-3 feets. It also protects the bumpy camera.7. Warp charging with 100% charging within 1hour 10 minutes.8. Alert slider for changing profile modes.9. Extended 1 year warranty on registering the product on one plus care. You can also refer your friends and earn points to redeem.Cons:1. No headphone jack, you have to buy a connector or OnePlus bullet headphones seperately.2. Fingerprint reader is bit of a issue since it doesn't work properly 10-20% of the time.3. Gets heatedto some extent on contunuous usage (depends on what application you are using though).4. Battery life is not the best if you are a hardcore gamer, however it's get along well for a normal daily usage at 60hz refresh rate lasting for more than a day.Conclusion:A great device for daily normal usage, clicking really snappy photos, for an enhanced viewing experience. Only if you want a better battery life with a bezel less design (not even a notch) and a better ram management you can think of going for OnePlus 7T pro by spending that extra 16k. Nevertheless it's a great buy, worth every penny!And now if you are in a dilemma whether to wait for Rog Phone 2 or not, my suggestion would be only go for that if you are into hardcore gaming almost for 12*7. Otherwise it's not available in stock all the time and flipkart doesn't provide great exchange offers along with Asus like OnePlus does in different festivals like diwali, and i hope in upcoming Christmas also they will be providing the extra discount facility in exchange of phones. OnePlus has a referral program on various occasions that gives you extra 2k off and adding to that different bank offers makes OnePlus the best buy over Rog phone 2, since both are priced at the ₹37,999 (base variant).Hope this review will help all the reader's, peace out! ✌️🤘

723,5.0 ,"  I am reviewing this device after one day of usage and I think the words can't describe it all.U purchase it than feel it.As I was using iphone7  for last three years and u know the battery backup of old generation.we need to carry power bank with us for every outgoing.I want to purchase a new mobile and first thought came to my mind was one plus and when I read the reviews about one plus battery,I was little worried.But now it is in my hand and I am reviewing this,I charged this full at 10 PM and now it's 8 PM next day .it is still having 10% of battery.so all I wanna say don't think too much before purchasing it.It's a killler phone in each and every aspect.The main thing of concern was  battery issue and now I hope I have cleared a bit and as u already know in every other aspect it is master.Camera 10/1090hz 10/10Look 10/10Sound 10/10Sensor 10/10

"
724,5.0 ,"  This is a phone that I would recommend even today over the OnePlus 8. The new model simply doesn't have enough features to warrant nearly 10000 extra apart from 5G(which is a few years from reality in india.ProsGood battery life(about 7&1/4 hrs with 90hz, 8.5 hours with 60hz)Great software, basically stock android except with a few tweaks. Much better than the samsung I was using temporarily.Good quality display with small notch, however the bottom bezel is a bit noticable.Great build quality, however it's a bit heavyThe length is about a normal 5.5 inch display phone with normal bezels so you can imagine size as reaching the top corners of the phone to determine, however it's a narrower display so not as wide.Speedy with bootup time of about 10 seconds and with 8gb ram it's really very nice in keeping apps in background. The OnePlus 8s processor is not much of an improvement and so this is better value.Speakers are very nice with two speakers, the one in earpiece also works as speaker and it's quite loud, have to keep at 70% volume.ConsCameras are not as good but I am not much of a photographer. The selfie camera is very good.OnePlus has fallen from their software update speed since the days of my OnePlus 3 and this phone has March security update as of end of May.Glass back so you have to keep this in a case to prevent breaking it. Display repairs are also expensive at about ₹12000Proximity sensor is awful and this doesn't have pocket mode like old OnePlus phones. So it keeps trying the fingerprint in the pocket. Also during calls it doesn't work sometimes.So a pretty good phone for a good price at about 35000.

"
725,5.0 ,"  A perfect phone with great performance and great look. Using around a week now and I am very happy with the phone so far. Battery life is good, lasts for more than 24hours with mild usage. Camera quality is excellent. Front camera is also superb. Really, OnePlus 7T is a complete package.Amazon's service is awesome and fast.You need to buy headphone jack or wireless earphone separately.

"
726,5.0 ,"  Honestly speaking... It's a great device. Camera is one of the main highlight of this device. And the wrap charge 30T is extremely fast. It charge the phone in an hour. But there is only one issue that I am facing is raise to wake and tap to wake is working properly in my device. Means sometimes it's working and sometimes it's not. The issue for this is I've press the power button then only I am able to unlock the screen. I hope this issue will get resolved in near future.

"
727,5.0 ,"  I m speechless with the quality and features that oneplus provides.One plus 7t is absolute marvellous crafted product .It has got a very fast fingerprint reader and a very fast face unlock ...the speed of the mobile is very fast and switching from one app to another is is so easy now .Thanks oneplus for such an amazing product .The only problem I encountered was the battery .The battery gets exhausted very soon but if you use it to the nominal rate ,it can survive for a 11-12 hrs .Not useful for watching movies or playing games for a long time without charging.It has got an Excellent camera with 2-4 option for zoom distance and many other options in pro mode .Dark mode is also good .

"
728,5.0 ,"  A true upgrade from Oneplus 7. Have been using it for 5 days and here are the pros and cons-Pros-+ 90 Hz display+ really fast charging in 30 mins it hits 70 %+ Oxygen OS, having used Redmi phones this is much more smooth and definitely OS wise this feels more premium+ Macro mode is just great with really indepth close object clicking+ Gaming and Frantic mode - This has been there in other phones as well but is worth a mention+ No heat up issues till now - Played Asphalt 9 and COD for 3+ continously but didn't heat up+ Super fast face detection and fingerprint sensorCons- Image stabilization while clicking pictures was an issue sometimes- Battery lasts about 14 hours but with such fast charging its a non issue for me- The camera notch but it gets solved as most of us put cases- Colour options are only 2- No Memory card slot with very high resolution clicks your memory will get over very soon, wpuld recommend you buy a 256 gb one for 2k more and not make the mistake I did- Earphones not included in the box. While I don't have much of a problem with removal of the 3.5 mm jack, it should at least be compensated with USB C or bluetooth headphonesFinally, the cons are not many and pros really outweigh them.Final rating - 4.5Verdict - Go for it, at 38k its a steal

729,5.0 ,"  This phone is a masterpiece... 👌👌👌👌PROS-1) Fast speed of this phone is unbelievable2) Best touch i have ever seen3) Best display with superb gaming mode4) the most impressive part is dolby atmos speaker.. it gives a out of the world feeling5) superfast face unlocking in microseconds6) Night mode camera is unbelievable and Macro lens can take clear photo of even a pen nib..7) stunning premium looks CONS-I was using iphone 7 which is one of the slimmest and handy phones of all time.. So being a first time user of bigger size screen phone.. I found it a bit bigger while handling with one hand... but if you compare similar size phones then this is one of the most handy phone available in market today.

"
730,4.0 ,"  There is nothing to dislike about it but this is rather a suggestion for OnePlus . As per my knowledge and many tech reviews the back glass is very fragile of the OnePlus 7t .This is mostly because of the large camera cutout in the glass panel .The camera's are horizontal under the glass so I think it would have been better if the camera style would have been like the Galaxy s10 thus would have raised the durability of the overall device.

734,5.0 ,"  The phone works Amazing. I was using one plus 3 before buying this product. One plus is becoming bigger and better. The phone is smooth runs efficiently even if there are multiple apps running at the background.I transferred the entire data through one plus switch app and it took 20 minutes to transfer 40 Gb data. the finger print scanner and face recognition features are just cool. The battery has a great back up. It doesn't exhaust easily. The phone box contained a silicone case and a prefit tempered glass. The phone interface is new and different than other Samsung Smartphones which looks alike.. The company offered one year screen replacement through acko insurance which is a blessing in disguise.Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone..

I carry the charger everywhere.Inspite of tweeting i got no response from them.. speaks volumes of their customer careI wish I had never bought it.... suggest u dont too

740,3.0 ,"  There was a date of purchase issue which reduced warranty coverage and made phone ineligible from accidental protection plan purchase. amazon did not help correct the issue and their customer support kept giving standard replies. . Got it corrected through OnePlus support after a long list of mails and time and effort investment. Still adding another two stars as the issue was resolved by OnePlus.

"
741,5.0 ,"  Top notch smartphone with the best specs available in the market right now. I am more than happy with the product, it aces every aspect of the smartphone kudos to Amazon for such a fast delivery, delivered my product the very next day of ordering and kudos to OnePlus for making this beast of a phone, which serves all purpose. The photos I attached with my review were taken with OnePlus 7t front camera. Both the rear cameras and the front camera are excellent and comparable with the likes of iphone 11 which is twice as expensive atleast here in India. There is ois and eis for video recording which is super stable the rear cameras can record the video upto 4k at 60fps, it's just the front camera only supports video recording at 1080p 30 fps no 4k support on the front camera.

"
742,3.0 ,"  Mediocre phone, not upto the hype created about it. Lacks in terms of extensive menu details, software to name a few. Original camera app is not good, searched for Gcam mod and loaded it, which improved camera quality a bit. No preloaded apps matching the processor and RAM.

"
743,2.0 ,"  Phone started hanging in just 2 months. Battery is also being exhausted in less than 8 hours even on moderate uses. No games, no heavy apps nothing. Storage is 2/3 available. Only moderate youtube video streaming and Social media accessing can drain out the battery in less than 8 hours. Phone hangs frequently. I had to turn off google assistant voice command coz it poping up automatically while doing something on your phone even while watching video without having phone in your hand. Camera quality is ok ok. Expected a better one from oneplus.Conclusion is Don't go for it. It bit costly than its value for money.

745,5.0 ,"  This is the fourth one plus phone I had bought after one plus 2, 5 and 6T. One plus 2 just gave up recently after 4 years of usage. Decided to replace it with this new phone. No complaints so far with butter smooth operation on Android 10 and oxygen OS. My usage is limited, I have been charging only once for a day and by changing the refresh rate to 60HZ  the charge on phone really stands out. The camera is good but could have been amazing.  Overall a amazing piece of product for this price.

746,2.0 ,"  The phone is amazing. But my device(s) had few issue issues, including display issue.1. It used to have a pink tint occasionally, especially on low brightness. It was clearly visible.2. Auto rotate and auto brightness were stopping sometimes.3. The screen below the area of fingerprint scanner became unusable sometimes.I complained to Amazon and they were really helpful. I got a replacement. But sadly, the replaced device had the exact same display issue. Maybe the batch has got some defect or it's a software issue, only experts can tell.Amazon helped again and gave me a return.I really liked the phone though. It has amazing camera, speed, sound and battery life. But I didn't want to keep a faulty device, hence I returned it. I'm grateful to Amazon for helping me and maybe I'll buy the same phone again after some time and try my luck again.

757,3.0 ,"  This is my first Oneplus device. My previous device was Mi A1. I have been using this device since 9th Oct and below are my inputsCons1. Camera images lack sharpness.2. Portrait mode images are below average.3. Hanging issues when used camera continuously for long time.4. Too many bugs. Ex. Not able to upload images in WhatsApp many a times, need to restart for make it work. Intermittent issues that restricts usage of camera to capture video.5. Fingerprint scanner is not reliable.Pros1. Good display.2. Faster processor.3. Fast face unlock.4. Fast battery charging.One plus have spoilt it's image and trust by releasing such an unstable device. It might be to take advantage of festive season but has put customers in dilemma, to return it or wait for Oneplus to fix such serious bugs.I have replaced a piece after it failed performance test of Blancco(Amazon testing tool) once and I faced issues in both devices.Based on my experience, I would like to return this device. When I use available option to return the device, I am shown message to contact One plus for solving problems. I feel cheated with this message from Amazon . I will call them and check available options for returning it.

760,5.0 ,"  Hello everyone! You might be thinking like me what might be the best deal on the phone,sadly I couldn't see any reviews mentioning how much they gave for the phone on which sale....hence I will do that before that quality and everything is fine there are a lot of detailed reviews and I agree with them..moving on I bought this phone for 37000 I.e 1000 discount through SBI card to my surprise  merely after 3 days amazon comes up with another 1000 cashback along with SBI card,hence making it 36k looking at which I regret buying it for an extra 1000 sometimes it's always better to wait and watch  until the last date of a particular offer period to see if some other offers stagger up and get you a good profit....To sum it up the best deal I have seen is 36k so if you are currently viewing that price then go for it

"
761,4.0 ,"  It's a great phone. Phone lasted for more that 6 hours at the first week of usage. Now it only lasts about 3 - 5 hours screen on time. Camera is good. Games are amazing. PUBG and COD run with no lag. I haven't faced any heating issues. One thing I hate after switching from my OnePlus 6 to this is that they didn't include the previous gesture that was present in Android 9. I checked in 7, 7 Pro and they had it.

"
762,5.0 ,"  So, I've been using this device since last week and this is my first flagship phone previously I was using Moto G5s Plus both them have same camera cutout :p. I have attached some camera samples which i clicked using nightscape mode, normal, and macro mode.I was confused between Oneplus 7t and Asus Rog Phone II, but Rog wasn't available so i chose this and really satisfied by it's performance. First of all I'm not hardcore gamer i usually play for hour or two. This phone provides great graphics without getting any heating issue at all. This phone has great battery life as well. I charge it once in a day and it gives me full day battery easily. I use it in 60 hertz and dark mode as it soothes my eyes.It gives you great in-hand feel. It is not so heavy.The thing which i didnt like that is it doesn't have 3.5 mm jack and the screen is long but it fits in my pocket very easily.I wanted frosted silver but wasn't available so, i bought glacier blue which is really good with it's cover

"
763,5.0 ,"  It's been less than a week that I am using this phone and I think I made the best decision to pay a little extra and go for OnePlus 7t instead of OnePlus 7. I had also considered going for Samsung S10e but OnePlus took my heart with its feature richness as explained below out of which half of the features are missing in Samsung S10E.I think the display of OnePlus is far far better than the display of Samsung Phones which I considered to be the best so far.The specs provided are too good for the price. The specific specs that I loved are -1. Fluid Amoled Display2. SPEEEDDD (the 7th generation of OnePlus phones is known for its speed and it holds to that promise very well). Samsung stutters after a while with speed.3. Dolby speakers (you really don't need Bluetooth Speakers anymore)4. How can I forget Oxygen OS! If you're into hassle free yet minimum customisable OS then this one's for you.5. Camera is great too. Look in the attached samples for clarity in outdoor lighting conditions. Also a wide angle shot which does a great job with the field area covered.6. Playing PubG in gaming mode at top-end levels is super smooth and flawless.7. Fingerprint Sensor is pretty fast. Didn't experience even a single moment of complaining about indisplay sensor.8. Battery life decent enough for 9-10 hours on moderate usage but the Warp Charger makes up for all the lacking points here. Thats too quick.9. Super Macro is amazing. I loved to play around with it. Please have a look at samples which were taken keeping the camera too close to the subject and the details captured were awesome.The only con that I particularly didn't like was a - No headphone jack but when you see the overall Package. It really don't matter to me much.It looks premium and IT IS A PREMIUM ANDROID EXPERIENCE. Myself being an FANdroid lover, this is the best Android I have ever used.*Reasons to buy or not to buy -If you love Android and don't want to spend more than 40K, than go for it without thinking twice !!!Unless and until you're an Apple fan and really want to go for iPhone 11 which is nearby the price range of this, than this is the best option in this price segment.

"
764,4.0 ,"  Been using it for over 3 months, its a treat. One of the only downsides that I faced with this mobile is some bugs with a couple of popular apps like WhatsApp where the Gboard hangs when I try to switch to another app. Although bugs like this are not uncommon when it comes to android devices, it is still a factor u must consider whenever u have u choose between IOS and Android as IOS is far less buggy.

"
765,5.0 ,"  Its the best premium phone at this rate. I have been using this phone for last one month. Charging speed is suprising, back camera quality is awesome. OS and updates are fabulously packed. Oneplus front camera needs some update. I would give 8.5 out of 10. 1 mark deducted for pricing, which could have been worked out. 1/2 mark for front camera. It's like a must have phone in your pocket.

766,1.0 ,"   My phone got delivered today. Having worst experience unable to switch it on. It is going to reboot loop as soon as I try to switch on.

767,5.0 ,"  OnePlus have made a great change in the 7 series. The camera is way too nice and the AMOLED display is also pretty good. The phone is so smooth than I've imagined.The fingerprint is pretty good and it's fast. The battery life is also good.The thing I hate is:The camera bump- the camera is fine but I'm not so satisfied with the camera bump. It actually represents the Motorola series. But my point is, it's too bumpy. Other OnePlus varients doesn't have this kind of a problem and still I don't know why this came up with OnePlus 7t. But I've made a solution by having a spigen rugged case which cots almost 800/-. It's actually preety good with the OnePlus 7t and it fits perfectly.

780,3.0 ,"  Everything about the OnePlus 7t is absolutely great as far the performance is considered. But one thing which still bothers me is that, it crashed while I was playing Call Of Duty mobile. Like literally I couldn't finish the game at all. Now I'm no expert, but one thing is certainly obvious that OnePlus 7t is a device which should be able to withstand high graphic games in extreme modes. However, I doubt if it could have been a software problem from the game itself unable to run smoothly on my device or was it my phone's problem? I don't know...all things considered #PUBG works Great on my phone even in extreme graphic OnePlus 7t can pull it off without a sweat. But I gotta tell you though your hands are gonna sweat it out.😜#Fingerprint Scanner.It's okay and not so fast as those dedicated finger prints sensors I'd say, but sometimes it failed to recognize my own finger prints!! So I'd give it 6 out of 10. And I've got my reasons for rating it that way and it's pretty convenient if I'd explain why, besides it's much easier to understand practically.😅#Camera PerformanceIt's pretty great I love the way OnePlus represents their Camera Performance although it's not up to Max. Nightscape mode works better when there's more light in the background.🥰

"
782,5.0 ,"  Excellent phone. Fingerprint reader is crazy fast. Camera is second tier in terms of smartphone quality, which is still great especially considering the price. Battery life is awesome, getting around 7 hours of screen usage time with social networking and YouTube at moderate brightness, 4-5 hours gaming at moderate brightness. With warp charging, I got from 11% to 93% in around 55 minutes. There is no overheating even after extensive gaming. Performance is ultrasmooth with SD855+ and the awesome 90Hz display. I have played only COD on this phone. With max graphics quality, high frame rate and anti-aliasing turned on, the game still plays very smooth. Great colours with accurate blacks on the AMOLED screen but max brightness is slightly short of adequate. You'll struggle a little bit under the sun. Adaptive brightness needs fixing. Tends to turn the brightness down too much. The stereo speakers would've been amazing if both of them were front-facing but only is. They're still loud and clear. Multitasking is exceptional with apps not shutting down even after gaming. Social media feeds resume/refresh from where you left off. Overall, well, bang for the bucks!

"
783,5.0 ,"  Awesome device ❤️🤩. Just go for it blindly 😍. Oxygen OS is too good. Camera Quality is also terrific 🥰✌️ battery lasts almost a day if not a heavy gamer 🙌.

785,1.0 ,"  Facing so many software problems........the pubg game is not running properly..........i am not complaining about whole OnePlus 7t seriesBut my device have so many problems...  LikeShearing from gallary is not done properly, without using volume button or physical key the phone automatically on silent mode,the songs are automatically change or restarted without accidental touch....... And havey dsync is take place while i am playing pubg on good network or good ping..... what's is also not open some times and so many app does not respond many times...........I am not expecting such type of performance from the #Oneplus# brand..........I spend 34999/- and get this :-(Now i have only one option.....i.e(service centre)Thank you Amazon

786,4.0 ,"  First of all the phone is really great. The phone does have its pros and cons. Im writing the review for people who are thinking of buying this.Pros:1) Snapdragon 855+ processor with 90Hz of refresh rate means the phone doesn't lag or hang. If it does check with the buyer. Most people on amazon dont check the buyer and end up crying foul.2) Finger print and face unlock its really impressive with the speed.3) It has a customized Oxygen OS and that works pretty well with the kind of customization the brand has put in.4) Design and the matt finish gives the phone a stylish look.5) Battery life is really good. I have almost 300 plus apps and I easily use it for a day or two with all the surfing and writing mails. The warpt charger charges the phone somewhere between 30 to 45 minutes.6) Dolby speakers and colors of videos bring it to life.Cons:1) Doesn't have a ear jack and the brand doesn't provide an earphone which is pretty bad as a user is paying close to 37k to 40k.2) I thought the camera is ok. They could have done much more with the quality. Tag disappointed with it.3) The phone did heat up initially raising a concern but over time it hasnt been that bad.4) Not sure about the quality of buttons and lastly they havent officially mentioned anything about waterproof and dust proof.Overall its a good phone. Hope it gives a bit of insight for people who want to buy this phone. Cheers.

787,1.0 ,"  I had lot of expectations with this phone. But after 3 months of usage, this phone is lagging like any other mid range samsung phone. It's better to buy a 20k samsung phone than this plastic mobile. The 90hz display has got nothing new, when your phone keeps on lagging there is no point having other features.Don't buy this phone ever

"
788,5.0 ,"  Pros:1. 90hz display giving a really smooth experience.2. Snapdragon  855+ processor giving great performance.3. Warp charge 30T helps charge the phone amazingly fast.4. Build quality is really great. The phone looks gorgeous and premium to hold.5. Stereo speakers in the phone gives immersive experience while watching videos and playing games. It is loud and clear.6. Haptic vibration makes gameplay better. I really liked it.7. Oxygen Os gives best user experience. Period.Cons:1. Camera quality is descent not great. It click some amazing shots but not exceptional as expected.2. Battery life is not that good maybe because of 90hz display. Normal usage can provide you full day battery life but if you play games then battery will take a great hit.Overall, a great buy at this price point.

789,5.0 ,"  It is the first oneplus phone which i buyed it for camera but oneplus made me down with the pics which i clicked was much saturated, oneplus have to fix this problem, the photos look unrealistic,and  am very dissappointed about front camera selfie is too bad to click; where as displays are good and quick responsive.. Battery life is good and am in love with oxygen OS which made me a bit satisfied

"
790,5.0 ,"  The best phone I ever used in my life , its really smooth , fast and handy , I feel like holding it while day and still I will not get tired , comes with 90Hz and fluid AMOLED display really a masterpiece and game changer also it's battery last 5-6 hr on screen and that's quite good for daily general use and for gamers not a big deal because it has 30T warp charger which works brilliant and I have writing this review after using for 3 months and more  and it's really and beneficial and not to forget about its classic camera the new round orientation and pro 👌 level of photography make anyone mesmerized and truly appreciableThanks to OnePlus team for such a great superphone

792,5.0 ,"  Originally I was an iOS consumer, it's quite hard to switch from iOS to Android but believe me I have been using OnePlus 7T from past 1 week and I can say that this one hell of a phone, be it Camera wise, battery wise, performance wise, price wise and above all interface between hardware and software is exceptional. Go for it. Money's worth. #WELLDONEONEPLUS #KEEPITUP.......)

"
793,1.0 ,"  I have been using this for the past 6 months. Given the brand and it's specifications I purchased it blindly but past few months I have totally dissatisfied.Problems:Touch doesn't work sometimesAPP crashesBattery discharge while charging and also no indication while chargingPreviously it used to be flagship killer but nowadays it is bluffing it's customers nothing else.Very dissapointed

"
794,5.0 ,"  This is an all-arounder.You won't find any area where OnePlus has not checked the box.• Excellent performance.• Camera good enough.• Loved the dual dolby speakers. You can feel the surround sound without headphones. Awesome for watching movies and videos.• I have always loved OnePlus design, and this doesn't disappoint a bit. Premium feel in the hands.• Display is fantastic for 4k content.• Battery has been good until now. Battery discharge a bit faster when refresh rate is 90hz ( Expected , needs to be compromised somewhere :P )• Only con I have is missing headphone jack. I had recently purchased Sony extrabass wired earphones for my OnePlus 5 ( I know converter can be used, but couldn't find one for now). Should invest more on Bluetooth headphones.

"
795,4.0 ,"  I love this phone for its fluid OS and Performance, only problem is it's battery life. It drains faster than other phones with similar battery size. Altho this is compensated by the super fast charging, but still it's an issue worth mentioning.Camera is great, tho can be improved. I use google cam on my device.Hope they fix all this in future Updates.

"
796,5.0 ,"  The phone at 90Hz display setting is a treat to use. Oxygen OS has a number of settings to customize the overall look and feel of the phone. The camera lens setup at the back is an on-off for most given the horizontal lineup inside a circular disc. A phone with 8GB RAM running at 90Hz display deserves more battery juice than the current 3800 mah although the warp charge does a fairly speedy job to charge the phone. Overall, a very good phone to watch videos at high definition, game at high resolution and click good pictures only let down by the relatively lower battery backup.

"
797,5.0 ,"  So had to choose between this phone and the rog2. Both are excellent phones and was a tough choice. Flipkart having less availability of rog2 made the choice easier in the end :) moreover, one plus is now a trusted brand name so that helps. Its pros - lighter, trustworthy brand, quicker charging speed, more professional look, better camera, macro lens!Cons - 3800mah battery compared to 6k mah of rog2. Did not expect the phone's battery to really last more than 12 hours, which is fine since we all charge at night atleast, however to my surprise it's been lasting for more than a day!Plus the warp charge is indeed as good as marketed, got around 75% in half hour from 1%.The fingerprint reader and camera are very good, having no issues. The 90hz refresh rate is probably just a new marketing thing to attract better prices. Even an above average user won't notice it. Not sure what 1 has to do to even notice it lol. The screen quality is awesome indeed though.Hope these details help.

"
798,5.0 ,"  Well, One of the best decision to invest money in electronics. This phone is really a masterpiece. What a build quality, what a camera, what a surround sound, what an amoled screen, what a great software optimization of Android. It is impossible to find a phone with this level of performance in this price bracket. I ordered it the moment it launched and never felt it was a wrong decision. 400000, 256 GB. What else you want. Now my phone has double the Ram my laptop has. Do you belive that? The 90 hz display is awesome..Great job oneplus as always. Keep it up.Just onething you should change. This  phone is not a mid range phone. So, please make sure to put a headset inside it. That will be a bang for the buck.

"
799,1.0 ,"  I am very unsatisfied with this phone, some applications are not working with mobile data while they are working fine with wifi connection. I already replaced my first OnePlus 7t device becuause of the same issue and bought a new one and after approx 2 month same issue is emerging in this device also... I already made complaints regarding this issue and they provide some technical solutions but still it's useless. Now they are saying we will pic your phone and upgrade your device software, it means if i give them my phone then i have to wait for some days to get my phone back till i have to live without phone...Just a worst device i ever used, if u are thinking to buy it please go for some other oneplus device or on other brand

801,5.0 ,"  I'm very much in awwwee.... After using this mobile, I love the way this mobile sees(Camera) everything.. I mean you just have to point it at what you want to capture & click it. This is for Pro's & as well as for beginners.The Macro shots are something that is amazing, the light collected by the sensor is great for low light photography. Overall this is a very beautiful phone to have your hands-on.Just 1 issue I have is, I didn't get a 3.5mm to type C connector.That's it, thank you :)

"
804,2.0 ,"  There is a lot of difference in performance and quality of product from expectations that have pop up due to name of 1+ phones.I have purchased two both from Amazon within 1 year. Screen and display quality is not even close to expectations. Both phones are non functional as of now.

"
805,5.0 ,"  OMG!!!!!!! This is no doubt the best smartphone one can have in the 40k price bracket. The display, battery life, UI, smoothness because of 90Hz and the camera all will give you more than the value for money. Though it might it a while for me to get used to the bigger screen size since I have switched from I phone 7. One plus 7t still fits comfortable in my hand.It has some crazy additional features like Zen mode, reading mode and the oxygen OS customization is just beautiful.Even after a good days use with heavy media consumption and moderate gaming, I still have enough juice left to last 3-4 hours.This is a must buy

"
806,1.0 ,"  If you want Quality buy iPhone. If you want features at budgeted price VIVO, OPPO, REDMI, MI will do. Proper balanced phone SAMSUNG with service back up.I fail to see any merit buying one plus though I took the plunge and bought it. Phone fails interminnetly with camera failing, phone stalling and slowness. Even rebooting and factory reset doesn't help. With no proper service backup in a metro like Bangalore THIS phone is simply not worth it. Waste of money- Typical CHINESE glam shot, works as long it can and then its sad story.

"
807,5.0 ,"  I purchased this phone on 29th September and thus this is a review after using it for about 10 days.Pros-1. Camera-Macro mode is love!2. Display- Fluidic display which everyone will love3. Processor and RAM- These make the phone superfast4. Service- I received a defective product which the service center replaced in just one day! Overall happy with the service, they were prompt and responsive.5. Charging- Warp charge 30T is the best! Charges 3800mah battery in less than an hour.6. Stereo speakers- loud and crisp7. Notch is little bit smaller than OnePlus 7Cons-1. Battery- Not upto expectations, earlier I owned OP5 which had 3300 mah battery which later more than a day on average usage. But this phone just clears 24 hrs on moderate usage and if we play games like pubg, it just can't reach 24 hrs. Though I get about 5-6 hrs screen on time which is good.2. No 3.5mm jack- It can be a con for this device but I assure you that listening from type-c is much better than the jack, try to experience it yourself.Overall, if you want a phone like OP7pro/7Tpro at less price and can give up curved display, I think this can be the best choice. Just go for it.

"
808,5.0 ,"  I've been using this phone for a month now and I can rightly say that this is the best phone I've ever used. The processor is extremely fast and I can switch apps easily. Camera is also amazing even in night mode. Fingerprint reader is extremely fast. The only con I found is that battery could last longer. It lasts an entire day with average to heavy use but still OnePlus could have done better. Also, it lacks notification light.

"
809,5.0 ,"  The camera quality is too good as compare to other mobile phones. But the battery life is little issue.Rest everything is too good as expected😍

"
810,5.0 ,"  Good speaker.Good camera, macro specially and night mode.Good display.Oxygen OS is great as you already know.Gamming is good but may increase temperature some times.Battery drains fast if screen refresh rate is set up to 90hrzs.Fast charging can do a full charge within 20 min I guess.The given silicon cover will become red from transparent eventually.No 3.5 mm headfone jack, so bought a Bluetooth one.Amazon exchange policy is bad. Delivery boy came and can not scan the barcode, told that will be back in one hour. After getting out of my house, cancelled the order immediately. Amazon customer care is dumb. Say can not help with that any way. Raised a complaint but never get back to me. So have to order again with 3000 extra bucks.

"
811,5.0 ,"  Fantastic purchase at this price. The OnePlus 7t has a mesmerizing design, silky smooth performance with a 90Hz display, stellar camera which has the potential to be further improved with updates and above average battery life which can last you a full 1 day and then some more with a solid 6hrs SOT. The notch is a bit of a bother but you tend to get used to it although I found Netflix and Asphalt 9 ran with a black bar eliminating the notch. I don't know if this is the case with others also. Summing it up, at the price of 40k for the higher 256 gig version you won't find a better deal. Period. Grab it while you can. And did I mention that it also comes preloaded with the spanking new Android 10?

"
812,5.0 ,"  This phone has the best features.It is mentioned that the battery life is 3800mAh, you may think that it is less when compared to other flagsgips. But don't think it is less. It is more than enough for day to day life. This charges very fast as mentioned (0-100% in 40min).Camera is also excellent. You may need some software for converting videos before sending to other devices. This is because in this device you will get 1080p,4k but if some play the same in other device it will be of low quality. Don't think your phone has some problem. That's all.

"
813,5.0 ,"  All that you need in a flagship is present in the OnePlus 7t. Superb camera, top of the line processor, handles everything like a dream. Truly never settle.

"
814,1.0 ,"  WhatsApp in OnePlus 7t stopped working. Reinstalling WhatsApp will solve issue for about 10 minutes and WhatsApp stops working after that. For a new phone (9 days), these kind of issue not acceptable. I am trying to return this product and no proper response till now.

815,1.0 ,"  Everytime Oneplus come with new expensive bombs to destroy my faith on it!! This time more pathetic with a phone which doesn't have basic features!!

"
816,5.0 ,"  One Plus is Phone with amazing specs.As company says""Never settle"".Its full on with its words.-latest hardware with Oxygen Os.-90Hz refres rate with Reduced notch size.-Normal and wide angle camera options.-Nice look and feel of mobile.-Several user gestures options.-Its superfast & superfluid with HD+ display.-And above all 10 k less than one Plus 7pro with more than 90% features .Only drawback was battery. But when you are having a 90% refresh rate.Still fair enough for 1 and half day battery for normal user.Overall  a good package.

"
817,5.0 ,"  I once had Samsung Galaxy s2 and felt not to spend too much on smart phones and spending under 15k is more than sufficient. budget phones will work for some time and later issues arose like poor vendor support, camera quality, battery issues etc. As some say one shouldn't  expect best at lower prices. This is the best phone I used for far though it is just a week, but I liked it very much. The camera quality is Damm good. And I have captured most beautiful pics of my kids.

"
818,5.0 ,"  Probably the most value for money phone...you can directly compare with S10 in terms of feature and still about 22K less then base varient.It's not perfect but there are so many things you can achieve just with these many features. Coming from different flagships (iPhone5, Nexus 5, S7), this phone is no less then any of those.. great product.

"
819,5.0 ,"  Pros :1. Excellent display2. 90 hz is just an extra benefit, scrolling is very fast.3. In display fingerprint is very fast, so is the face unlock.4. Dual speakers are very loud and clear, Dolby Atmos is a charm.5. 30t wrap charge is very fast, charges from 0 to 100 in 55 minutes.6. Battery life is very good, easily getting 8-9 hrs SOT on wifi and 6 hrs on mobile data, standby time also good, all these sot on 90hz and mobile data always on.7. Wide angle camera and night sight camera is additional advantage, night sight is comparable to pixel.8. Haptic feedback is very good.9. Performance at top notch with 855 plus.10. Multitasking great with 8gb ram.Cons:1. Using pixel 2xl from long time, potrait mode is not as good as pixel, infact it is best on pixel.2. Ambient display is having bug in most of the devices, tap to wake and lift to wake not working lot of time, one plus please provide fix for this.Tips: use GCam for best camera results.Final verdict: Dont think and just get one plus 7t if having 38k budget.

829,5.0 ,"  Best features - warp charge, wide angle camera, huge storage in such affordable price.Battery life is not too shabby, lasts a day easily. OnePlus phones are very user friendly, especially with Oxygen OS. Zen mode is a great addition.One drawback is that the official accesories in OnePlus store are very expensive. Not many good quality and affordable accesories available in the market yet.

"
830,5.0 ,"  Very good phone, I am loving the display and specially the 90hz display gives a buttery smooth experience. Watching videos in this phone takes it to a different level.The camera is also very good, however the night mode does not produce good pics rather it looks very artificial. But in proper daylight and good amount of lights even in indoor conditions gives real good pictures.Battery is ok, gives me a full day with 30-40 leftover charge but definitely could have been better.

"
831,2.0 ,"  I have just disappointed by the battery life. And I have faced heating issue after a moderate use. Not value for money phone anymore. Camera is good only but no natural color production. Spending 37k for a phone without having a headphone or pop up camera with disgusting battery life is not acceptable. Only gimmick 90hz display and oxygen os will not take this brand to touch the same level as iPhone. Really disappointed.

But when i checked the un boxing video in youtube they have averthing imcluding the tempered glass and the head phone and backcase. It is a huge box. I think these sellers are taking off those accesseries and sent only the phone piece. I would suggest to walk in to the store and get one so that u can bargain and get some free accessories. We have to bargain n get what we need because these online sellers r big cheaters.

In dark places front flash operates automatically to deduct face to unlock...Triple camera is goodI was much impressed with wrap charging.. very fast charging..Mobile had heating issues, while playing free fire or pug, mobile starts to get heat in 20 mins.It's one of the best mobil from OnePlus. But,For 40,000INR many good mobiles are available in other brands.

841,1.0 ,"  It started to hang with in one hour of usage. When I tried to switch it on, it switch on and off continuosly. I tried to make a complaint, but they referred Blancco app to install and see the performance. It shows that my device is running correct. But I want to replace this device. I don't know whom to contact. Very worst experience with OnePlus while starting to use itself

"
842,5.0 ,"  Great phone..My first time experience in using OnePlus as well as a super amoled screen... experience is fabulous..even played call of duty and pro evolution soccer in extreme graphics and it handled it flawlessly..with the stereo speaker, gaming experience is a breeze...only thing that I noticed was that the camera tends to soften skin tones on potrait mode however works well when there is enough light exposure... battery life also feels quite adequate..had a drop of 10% battery after playing for 40 mins constantly...and with the warp charger..battery drop won't be much of a problem while gaming...overall a very good buy..I am loving the OnePlus experience 😍😍🥰🥰

843,5.0 ,"  Build quality is top notch..Feels premium in hand. Camera unit is pretty amazing in that prize range epically nightscape works like magic!. Snapdragon 855+ processor is crazy fast, pairing this with adreno 640 GPU and 8 gigs of ram any game available for android runs flawlessly and fluidly . For dynamic sund lovers the stereo speakers work really fine. Haptic motor is improved and you feel that while using the phone. Fingerprint reader situated under the screen is the fastest fingerprint reader in under screen fingerprint readers on different phones but comparing this with physical fingerprint sensors is not fair.And finally coming to its 90hz panel..its so good that once you get used to the fluidity of this panel you won't see anything on phone having frame rate below 90hz, the experience is magical. As a bonus you get warp charger 30T which is 18% faster than one plus 7 pro, its really handy to juice up your phone rapidly. To sum this up...A phone with 90hz panel, fastest processor by snapdragon, stereo speakers, quality camera setup, warp charger..This is the best option at this price point..Kudos!

I don't know about 90Hz Screen but UI is Simple and butter smooth.3. SP 855 Processor is blazing fast. No lag at all.Negative--1. No 3.5 mm Port and Dongle is not provided. So a BIG ZERO to ONEPLUS TEAM for that.2. I was expecting a better display at this price. A 2k amoled screen would have better.3. Android 10 is plane boring. OnePlus should have added more features.  So overall a decent Phone but should have priced @ 30k.

859,5.0 ,"  There’s no need of writing a review. It’s well known that Oneplus gives us great phones every year. And this time too they gave us a perfect phone at a decent price. Gives almost all features of Oneplus 7T pro. So if you have fund issues to buy pro then don’t hesitate to buy 7T. Only problem that caused me is the camera shape. I personally feel that the circular shape looks a bit too bulky for the phone ( still not a very big issue). But without that I give a 11/10 for this.

It hanged once while clicking pics but did not see it recur later on.30w Warp charge is a huge positive for this mobile, the mobile gets charged up in no time. From my experience it took close to 45 min to charge from 18 to 100 percent. Camera is pretty good as well no issues with it. When it comes to battery life I was easily able to get a day and a half on normal usage(Note: I'm not a gaming person, so this view might be subjective)Definitely would recommend this product.

I find the build quality is very poor and very delicate . Oneplus warranty service is also not good  and they took nearly a month for diagnosis of the issue and inform me to pay for screen change which is not justified. This phone did not meet my expectations. So do not buy this expensive phone as it will disappoint you.

Battery is better and can still be optimized. Thanks to the warp charge 30T tech for its unprecedented charging time.Undoubtedly camera department needs improvement as Oneplus is no more a flagship killer rather a flagship itself :).

You won't regret playing any games on this.90hz feature : you will definitely feel a difference in using 90hz feature.. Switching between apps is like flowing water.. 5/5 for that tooAdding few clicks taken by this phone..Hope this helps 😊Overall if budget is around 35-38 and want a triple camera along with heavy duty phone you must go for this 😊 cheers

Might not matter for many.I've requested for a replacement and hopefully will get it in a day or two. Other buyers who have bought the phone should check on this as well since it could have affected an entire batch of phones.Otherwise, the camera quality is decent (not great). An iphone x or the Samsung galaxy note 9 would be better in this department.

The camera quality is outstanding it has 2x optical zoom 10x digital zoom and the ultra wide angle is superb !! It works really well on low light with it's new nightscape feature which will optimize the image and gives you the best image in low light . I was really impressed by the video quality which has ultra wide angle support in video mode 2x zoom, 10x zoom , and it even has video stabilization which was really impressive all those mode can be shoot in 1080p 30 fps, and 4k 30 fps, but the ultra wide angle doesn't support in 1080p/ 60 fps, 4k 60 fps. But then I was surprised with 4k 60 fps which is ultra smooth just like iPhone 11 pro video quality. It has the best video quality in this range which no other companies will provide you with this amount of money . It has the best spec in such a low price as compared to other flagship phone . And the performance is on the next level with the combination on snapdragon 855 plus and 90 hz refresh rate and the front firing dual streo speaker with game space and fanatic mode takes gaming experience to the next level which you won't find such experience in any other smartphone in this price range . I wonder why a lot people complaint a lot about the battery when it does gives you decent average with 3800 mAh. I only need to charge for 30 min which gives me almost a day battery life . The charger is super amazing with the wrap 30t which insanely charge in no time . It only takes 54 min to fully charge from dead phone 0% to 100% which is super fast which I have never experienced in any other smartphone in this price segment . My video experience with this phone is incredible with the fluid amoled display it gives you immersive video experience and the dual front firing speaker is so loud and clear which gives the video experience to the next level . The indisplay fingerprint sensor the super . This is my honest review after 3 months of usage  .

This phone is a clear winner in all the departments ! Say it Camera, Gaming, Multitasking, Battery life, its all top notch...The only thing I feel is, this phone could have been powered by 4000+ mAH battery which is 3800 as of now.With OnePlus fast charging it would have been cherry on top of the 🍰Other than that, its a BEAST

"
900,5.0 ,"  A must buy it's a charm to use this phone have upgraded from an iPhone 6s, was very doubtful about transition as was shifting from ios to androidafter 7 year.Only one suggestion oneplus should make some dimentionally smaller phones with same specifications.

"
901,2.0 ,"  I am not satisfied heats ups,battery drains quickly and hangs for 3 to 5 sec just within 2 days of purchase. I need a replacement on this.Fuck this phone mann its hanging continously wtf is d use of 8gb ram very baad quality phone plzz do not purchase it

"
902,1.0 ,"  This phone has to be the biggest con from One plus. The battery life is terrible. In a brand new phone it doesn't last a day. When I went to the one plus show room, they told me that the battery life is average, but is made up for by fast charging. Which doesn't sound promising.On top of it all, where did my usb jack go???? I now have to buy customized ear phones because even the coverter jack is too fragile and doesn't work!!!Don't buy this con.

"
903,5.0 ,"  This is my review after 2 days :Screen: Coming from a screen with a higher resolution than the 7T, I was weary about the screen. However the AMOLED screen on this phone blew me away with it's contrast and brightness. The 90Hz screen is another killer feature. A lot of people still seem to wonder if it makes a difference, I think it does. A friend of mine who hadn't heard of this phone before tried it and was immediately impressed by the smooth scrolling and animations.This is most definitely the best aspect of this phone.Performance: This is phone is rapid! I haven't encountered a hiccup yet. I do not game and hence cannot comment on the gaming performance. However I am a heavy user and didn't find anything that slowed down this phone. I'm also very pleased with the clean Android experience with Oxygen OS's useful features. Both face recognition and the finger print scanner are fastBattery: This is where I was seriously doubting the capabilities of this phone. However I'm pleased to report that I've had more than 6.5 hours of screen on time on both days. This included a lot of YouTube and Netflix using the phones speakers. This phone should easily get you through a day of use. I had also kept WiFi, Mobile Data (4G) and Location on at all times. Unless you are expecting something that lasts for 2 days , this phone won't disappoint. The new Warp charge 30T is amazing as well.Speakers: The speakers are something I did not consider much about while purchasing this device. But they've impressed me immensely. Dialogue is crisp and it gets plenty loud. I did try using my wired earphones with a OnePlus USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor and I didn't have any issues with the sound.Cameras: I have not tested the camera enough to post a review about them, nor am I a photographer. I will update this review when I do take more picturesHand feel: The phone feels solidly built. I did expect it to be heavier. It doesn't feel heavy at all and the weight is distributed very well, making it very easy to hold. Make no mistake, it is a large phone. However I found it much easier to handle than the 7 Pro which I was considering thanks to the flat screen, slightly narrower width and the evenly distributed weight.I do wish they did provide a USB-C to 3.5mm adaptor in the box. (3.5mm jack would be ideal. But that ship has sailed). Apart from this minor gripe, I'm very happy with this purchase.(For context, I have used a Samsung S5, iPhone 6, iPhone 6S Plus, iPhone 7 Plus and Nokia 8 as my daily drivers before this)

"
904,3.0 ,"  Camara does not match as I accepted, not detailing in camara picture picture like ordinary phone, not value for money. I suggest bay some other phone for detailing picture quality. I suggest to one plus replace all customer phone and improve camara detailing quality. Need some work on camara quality. Customer except DSLR quality picture from one plus 7t.

"
905,5.0 ,"  It is the best phone till date. It is so smooth in every tasks.PROS:1) Display: Display is buttery smooth. 90Hz display gives you a smooth performance.2) Battery: Battery is not so bad as it is being said by reviewers as it is giving me around 1 and half day of battery life in aggressive usage. I play heavy games a lot like pubg and Call of duty. And still the performance is nice.3) Camera: Believe me the pictures coming out from this phone are perfect. I am a professional photographer and i am pretty impressed by the performance of the camera.And the videos are also good and so are slomos.4) Sound: Stereo speakers of this phone are insane. I have used many stereo speaker smartphones and i am telling you the speakers from this device gives better sound.5) Charging: The phone charges from 0-100% in 60-70 mins. What else you want now?CONS:1) No 3.5mm jack as you all know. And the company is not providing any 3.5mm to type-c connector.2) No IP Rating. However, the company said that the phone can bear water splashes but the certification is what makes us comfortable.3) No wireless Charging. The device has a glass back but then too there is no wireless charging.But these cons are not a deal breaker.Note: At this price range OnePlus 7T is a great deal. Go for it blindly.

906,5.0 ,"  I have been using various other phones for the past 10yrs...This is the first time I am using a ONEPLUS model...and I am in love with this  ...Yes  I feel they could have improved the battery level but still the 90htz display ,camera quality,sensor  etc doesn't give any excuse.....if u feel battery is little weak according to our standard we can switch back to 60htz display in settings which improves batter life ...I will give 4.8/5 for this product where .2 is deducted for battery life...NB: one plus doesn't provide audio jack...they should rethink for providing free Bluetooth one plus ear phones with this device as we are paying this much amount...

"
907,5.0 ,"  Love the forested silver color.! Display is just awesome, the finger print scanner and the face unlock combo is so fast that It feels instantaneous on press of the power button, camera and picture quality could be even more better which I hope will be taken care of in upcoming updates, performance wise it's a beast once you enable the developers option and change the animation to 0.5X scale the phone just blazes through, getting solid one day battery after 6.3hrs of gaming(call of duty, pubg), lots of browsing and songs(video) and no heating issues yet, though I doubt it has the cooling unit like oneplus 7 and oneplus 7 pro and oneplus 7t pro. The speakers are  way too loud which is a good thing for movies, games and songs, bad thing that even the earpiece at the lowest level of volume is loud enough that the person next to you can hear the conversation pretty accurately in an office or silent environment.  Best buy for the money needless to upgrade to oneplus 7t pro and oneplus pro just for the pop-up camera(which can be annoying when you have have face unlock enabled as it will pop up every single time you try to unlock the phone eventually will worn-out the motor lot faster) and higher display resolutions which saves loads of money. Fastest charging I have ever seen. And hardwares specs are all upto the current trend that you don't have to even think of upgrading your phone for a very long time.

"
908,5.0 ,"  Its a performance beast. No question abt that. I just wish it had a better battery to go with other hardware. Mind you, the battery backup is not bad by any means. But i wont say its better than avg. Camera is good too, So long as you r not comparing it with the latest iphones or samsung and huawei flagships.Awesome screen and sound quality. Though i would have preferred a bit more bass from the pair of speakers.

909,5.0 ,"  Oneplus gives you premium quality phones in Android. Camera is best. Battery life is okay lasts for whole day but on very heavy work need to charge. Charging is just awesome 45min whole phn is charged. Bulit quality is pretty good. If you are thinking for android go for oneplus rather than expensive note phones. Oneplus always gives you update on time to time so no worry that your phone become old. I used oneplus 6 till it is getting updates. Unfortunately i lost it. I trust oneplus so again going for it. Oneplus is best for android no one can beat it. Really happy with my new oneplus 7t😀😀

At least Apple gives full accessories in exchange for the price it takes.I think oneplus have to provide complete accessories in the box.

915,1.0 ,"  One of the basic operations we do is connect via Hotspot.  However, when connected via hotspot if a call comes then the hotspot disconnects which is very very disappointing. I had used a Moto G followed by Apple iPhone XS & never faced this issue. This for me is a deal breaker as the phone charges a hefty amount & if this quality is not acceptable.

921,1.0 ,"  We are good at fingerprints though!Battery backup is also not good enough.OnePlus' mobile camera is also not as good as it should be.  People say that the camera of Plus is good.

922,5.0 ,"  Fingerprint reader is very fast, camera qualitu is awesome with all the features from nightscape to macro mode works really well, battery life is descent one plus should provide more powerful battery with this flagship device but 30t warp charger charges its very fast so you won't really feel anoying and i too hardly notices when my battery gets full within 40mins...thnx feel free to buy this amazing phone . Major missing is that headphone jack but once you,ll start using this fastest device you,ll forget about the 3.5mm jack.I am also shareing few camera samples which i have shot on different light conditions and in different modes, have a look on that. Thankyou

923,5.0 ,"  Best in class performance and 90Hz is mind-boggling, can't switch back to 60hz.Snapdragon 855+ is just an amazing processor and trust me you won't regret it.Since I have not invested in the camera, I felt the quality is great and far better from my previous Asus device. the image you see taken with 10x zoom on my oneplus 7T.Warp charger is fast and at last, I only say if you have the budget go for this

"
924,5.0 ,"  A wonderful Phone which excels in every aspect be it hardware, software, connectivity, looks & others.Battery is the only department where I am not extremely happy with this phone as it only lasts from a full charge to 10% from morning till evening. If I use it slightly more, I would need to charge it once during the office hours as well so as to have sufficient charge while travelling back to home. But all this is balanced by the Fast Warp Charging Feature pretty well.

I will describe you my experience in these 2 daysFirstly, kudos to Amazon for such a quick delivery and excellent packaging.Coming to the mobile, the first impression is just amazing. Its smooth, fast and you can't come out of it.The amoeld display is stunning and camera is amazing. Battery backup is also too good. And it took me 40 min to charge from 2% to 100%.PROS:CAMERA - 4.8/5BATTERY- 5/5Display - 4.7/5Performance - 4.8/5Speed - 5/5Gaming experience- 4.8/5CONSNO Headset jack.One Plus didn't even provide 3.5mm Type C Converter either which dissapointed me.Camera design could have been made better (But I feel better compared to Apple 11 pro)Glass back might shatter at fall keep it protectedOverall: 4.7/5 One Plus proves again why its the BEST MOBILE right now. Go for it.

928,5.0 ,"  Not going for the specs as they are already writtenThis phone is fast asf...90hz and oxygen os is one of the best out there.Battery life can be a slight issue for very very heavy user .. upon full charge I can play 3 hrs of PUBG and 2 hrs of yt and WhatsApp it can last for the day .. ending at around 10-15 percent but then again if u can charge it just once for half an hour it will give u an amazing battery performance.Thanks for warp charge.Only thing is 3,5mm jack it's not there u need to get official dongle from the store for it to work because the audio output except the official one is trash 3 Rd party vendor dongles won't give u nice audio ..I also faced issue during calling sometime(around 10 percent) where my voice was echoed for few seconds

Camera of this device is stunningly amazing, all modes are well optimized with the hardware to take the best shots, even the nightlife picture are far better than rest of the flagships. Fatherly smooth 90Hz Display, HDR10+ with superAMOLED and Dual stereo Dolby Digital surround sound makes this a mini theatre for watching videos of your interest, yes battery capacity could be better but Oxygen OS with Android 10 optimizes the hardware very well coz don't forget this OnePlus7Tis powered by QualcommSnapdragonn 855+ processer the powerful engine of 2019 with 8 gigabytes of RAM.

The camera is decent. The phone is way fast of course with the snapdragon 855 plus. Finger print unlock, best in the class and face unlock is blazing fast. Fastest among all i have used. But I do feel the battery capacity much have been a little bigger, it's only 3800, but again you get the warp charger. So it cover up this con. And love the colour even. An the Fluid amoled display with the 90hz refresh rate, brightness is good for outdoors even, goes up to 1000 nits. It's sick overall. So, Never Settle, it is.

938,5.0 ,"  The first thing that will strike you is the speed of the phone, there is absolutely no lag even when operating multiple applications. The on screen fingerprint reader is just amazing. The screen is super vibrant. The only flip side is it's battery and in some respect it's camera. But please don't be mistaken even with its shortcommings it can very well compete with top of the line flagship phones. It's a great deal at this price point when you consider it's specifications.

"
942,4.0 ,"  Overall phone is Excellent. Battery. Life is very poor at this price range and for this brand. 4 to 5 hours regular use will drain out the whole battery from 100 to zero. I hope OnePlus team will resolve this issue soon.Now after setting display on natural view from advanced amoled view and refresh rate from 90 to 60 htz it's battery time has been improved from 5 hrs to nearly 8 to 9 hrs very safely from 100 to 10%.

"
943,1.0 ,"  My feedback is about the ergonomics and design of this model. The proportion of the screen size is really abrupt. They have not increased both width and height of the phone, rather only the height. This makes it an awkward proportion to use, does not enlarge the viewed content whether videos or other content and feels rather uncomfortable if the purpose is to go for a slightly bigger screen. So while it has a particular rise in screen size compared to previous models, it doesn't actually function and rather is only misguiding.

"
944,2.0 ,"  Battery life - not enough to last more than half a day on a single 4G sim. Without extensive gaming.Heating issues - Even on simple facebook , YouTube apps the phone gets tremendously heated. Leaving aside the gaming apps .Fingerprint scanner - Not fast enough, doesnt read the edges properly, doesn't identify the fingerprint 4 out of 10 times.Gesture function- Misbehaves; like for the home or or recent apps and sometimes even for the back function.Camera quality - Nowhere near the hype led by oneplus of a 48 mp rear camera. Photos are not color cordinated, sharpness in the skin tone always missing.Not worth the price. No smooth experience as a smart phone . As a previous Owner of a oneplus 5t , I didn't like this new oneplus 7t as an upgrade & Dont recommend it to anyone.

Fingerprint sensor is ok wouldn't it is fast but is reliable but can go for really fast face unlock( i personally don't prefer it though).

May b.. may not be.Let's just jump in to ""battery life"" of this device.I have seen comments on battery life like it drains quickly.. and worst.. etc etc and still I have given 4 star out of 5 . Why ? . You have to understand that you are using 90 hz display not 60 hz. This ll consume more energy than 60. You can change the refreshing rate in display settings if you want a better battery life .Then what about rest of the performance/Build quality/cam etc ?. Just one word.. ""awesome"".

It's been 3 weeks since I purchased this phone and believe me it's a treat to hold this phone . Battery backup is really good , Tons of customization available and I really like the new Navigation introduced in this phone.

"
960,3.0 ,"  Performance is bad sometimes app gets stuck. Phone doesn't respond properly at times. Unable to place Royal battle mode on Call Of Duty. App closes automatically while playing this game mode. Tried reinstalling and playing again. It didn't work and still app closes by itself. Disappointed by the fake specs by one plus I feel. After using this device feels like it's just hype and advertising by One Plus. It's fast but not always. YouTube takes 3-4 secs sometimes to open. Camera is good. Faceunlock is superfast.  Battery drains faster. I have been using this phone for 13 days. Really disappointed by performance at times.

"
961,4.0 ,"  Well it was a flagship phone like features with better price and yes it has a long list of pros but if you are unlucky customer you'll get the worst display experience ever pixel in it floats and don't light up in low brightness and there's always a green tint in the upper side of the phone you'll be able to see in specific brightness level like 30 or something near that if you want to get it fixed at service center they'll deny that this is not a problem. Any way it drains battery a lot .

963,4.0 ,"  Phone feels very much premium in hands,performance of this phone is good,little bit disappointed about camera,as this struggle capturing photos  during low light,now if we talk about gaming on this phone-you will love this phone while gaming as this phone comes with 855+ soc,no stutter,no lags.After a full charge your phone will last almost a day,depends on your usage.but the added advantage is ,it comes with wrap charging.it takes almost 1 hr to get full charge.

"
964,5.0 ,"  1)Camera's are good. But can't compare to an Ip hone XR or Iphone 11 and above. So it needs to get improved.2) Battery is average. It would barely last for a day. But charging is fast like 0-70 in just 30mins. So that helps.3) Display is great. 90Hz feels really smooth. Colour Accuracy is great too.4) Software experience doesn't need to be explained. Oxygen OS is by far one of the best custom OS.5) Performance is great. No issues. One will enjoy using this device.6) Stereo speakers are great with great sound clarity, dolby atmos and sufficient loudness.

969,5.0 ,"  I am a previous user and fan of One Plus. Had a One Plus 6 for the past two years. Now wanted to upgrade it. Found One Plus 8 a bit expensive, as I use an iPhone 11 also, and tidings want to invest more in my second one. The screen resolution is excellent. The screen refreshing of 90Hz full AMOLED is amazing. The camera, with Macro lens scores over even iPhone Camera. And overall good purchase . *****

975,1.0 ,"  It's a very poor experience with amezon.I complained about one plus 7T  mobile handset that I received. Handset is overheating till 45 degree centigrade. But Amezon person says that it is a usual temperature and it's not abnormal.I requested them for return the device but they are not ready for it.As its not easy for me to handle the hot phone i requested them to return. But they tell that they can't do anything.I will suggest you all that don't bye costly products from Amezon..They serve only for cheap products.

"
976,3.0 ,"  I got the phone just two days back and when I powered it on for the first time the phone was way to hot to actually take a call. However i waited and wanted to check for atleast a day of usage. Heating issue is again happening on the second day especially near the top speaker area which I can feel while talking. Not sure whether some update is require or it's actually a problem. I suspect while playing heavy games it may go more high. So as of now I can say this phone has some heating issue. Attached the screenshots for thermal readings which I took from an app named CPUZ

"
977,5.0 ,"  This is my first OnePlus phone and it's awesome in almost everything Screen, Processor, RAM, stereo speakers, battery backup and it's Camera is truly awesome, You can take mind blowing Macro shots with it and video stability is great.

"
978,5.0 ,"  Simply superb. Totally a value for money product. Buttery smooth and awesome screen, Dolby Atmos sound is too good. For an average to heavy user the battery will easily last full day from morning to your bed time with all necessary and non necessary usage. Just go for it. It's the best for its asking price.Just wished they'd sent a type c bullets earphone in the box.

"
979,5.0 ,"  Such an amazing product. Display, performance, sound quality, os, warp charge are just awesome. But OnePlus should put a notification light and enhance battery performance.

"
980,5.0 ,"  All features are best about the mobile. But it has some heating problems while we do long video calls and when mobile is having enabled auto rotate and other services but in locked mode, battery discharges fastly. Need to optimise battery of mobile first.

"
981,5.0 ,"  All over the phone is very good, it’s looks and it’s processing speed is upto the mark. Some people dislikes its back side design... but I think if any one is buying as per specifications then it is easily ignorable. It’s is sleek enough. Quality of camera is also perfect, It gives real colour images. The only thing is body gets heat up soon.

"
990,5.0 ,"  Best bet for the money.Hardware : Best camera. Night photos are amazing. 90hz screen gives good user experience. Smooth as butter. But the catch is, battery drains fast, if 90hz mode is enabled. Fingerprint sensor is very responsive. Screen is kindof allergic to sweat, especially if put in pocket.Software: Android 10 + Oxygen OS doing its job very well. Best ever user interface experience. Clean and simple. Faced little glitches like irresponsive screen out of the box. But after March (2020) update, it works great.

"
994,5.0 ,"  I was using Oneplus3 for around 3 years and 6 months and had to upgrade. The pricing on the 7T was a little dissappointing so explored various other options. Could Never Settle for any of them because they lacked some or the other thing. This is a brilliant phone with amazing performance. UI and UX are 2 of the most important things for me and OP7T does all justice here.Oxygen OS on Android 10 beats all other Android UIs hands down.The power of SD 855+ and Adreno 640 enhances your UX, may it be multitasking or gaming.

"
1003,3.0 ,"  No doubt, 1+7T is a great phone but it has also some cons like...Small battery life....Portrait mode not work so well i.e. background not so blurred as it should be. In portrait mode some time camera fails to detect edges perfectly. In low light pixels got bursted in nightscape mode and same problem occurs while shooting video in super stable mode in low light.Software has lag, bulky and sometimes  phone got hang for more than 30 sec.But it all can be fixed by 1+ by software updates.Now I am reducing rating due to cheap quality accessories, my charging cable stop woarking as I used it very carefully. Its all happen after 6 months. My friend also facing this same problem.

"
1008,5.0 ,"  Great phone. Worth the amount.90hz refresh rate will take you places you have never been before in a phone.I am now a fan of warp 30t, nothing faster than this can be imagined. ( 20% to 71% in 15 minutes).The image of my bike was taken at 7.30 pm on a rainy night. I couldn't see my bike at a distance of 5m and yet 1+ performs exceptional. The sole source of light present in the image was the rear brake light(red one) of another scooter nearby.  I can vouch for the night mode of one plus nowCons:Flash : my MIA2 has a better flash than this -_-

"
1009,2.0 ,"  I have received the phone 2 weeks ago.In  phone screen  2 straight lines are coming on screen, when it  is on. Please refund or stop the emi payment or  replace my phone. Its not a good experience to have defective phone for Rs. 39,999. Looking forward for your response.

Battery drains quite easily but considering the quality of display it was inevitable but OnePlus manages it very well with the Charger provided that fuels up the phone rapidly. Quite surprised by the super macro mode which was beyond expectations. Video stability is an issue but expect it to be made better with system updates like always.

"
1013,5.0 ,"  I have been buying oneplus' phones before it became a well known brand. There is a certain peace of mind that comes with these devices which other brands cannot match, not even google itself. This phone continues everything that oneplus has been providing to its users for more than 5 years. It's crazy fast, super smooth and really really beautiful to look at, especially the frosted grey colour. It is a proper update from it's predecessor, oneplus 7, and the screen itself is worth the extra money spent. As such there are no cons for me, although I will wait and see how well the battery performs thanks to 90 hz display.In short, you can order it with your eyes closed😊

"
1014,5.0 ,"  Its smooth as hell. You click it and it respond. I switched from iphone 7 plus to oneplus and till date after use of 1 months, am satisfied with my choice. It gives you premium feel and performance every task. Nice product with quality.

"
1015,5.0 ,"  This is the ultimate mid-range beast.If you're waiting for OnePlus 8 please don't and go for OnePlus 7T.There are only minimal differences like 200mah improvd battery life, Camera and snapdragon 865.And 5g which is not yet available in India yet.As it is rumoed that the prices will increase, and you want to buy a lower pricd device, you should go for OnePlus 7T.

"
1018,5.0 ,"  Buttery smooth display. Camera quality good but can be better in low light.Few things to improve in OnePlus sw: oneplus messaging does not have swipe delete option of sms messages. Home screen layout of custom photos go out of screen as if zoomed out - should be user selectable or to resize image size as needed. Also i needed OnePlus analog clock widget (one with red smallhand) in homescreen but not coming.Having said, i love OnePlus for overall ui which is much better than stock android.

"
1021,5.0 ,"  I will not bore anyone with same repeated reviews about specs. But OnePlus has created (unintentionally) a perfect op7 series phone in this price. It's far better than op7 & op7pro, But at the same time it's not that worse than op7tpro considering its proce. If want to buy OnePlus then go for this one.

"
1022,5.0 ,"  Camera quality is great ... However in night mode it artificially illuminate the object which fails to capture the true dark background... But then its not a slr camera... Fingerprint sensor  is moderately fast .... rest ures experience is very good.. the case given in package is very cheap and ugly... I think they should provide better one..

"
1023,5.0 ,"  Can't complain much. Gets the job done well in all areas, it is one plus phone after all. Phone feels a bit bulkier, lengthier and thicker for a one plus 3 user like me. Difficult to fit the phone in small pockets - no trying to complain here, just saying.

"
1024,5.0 ,"  Received the phone today at 8AM and tested it till writing this review at 9.45PM. The box is new design long and red. The phone is immaculately packed. The blue colour I had ordered was amazing beyond words. The camera quality is better than any high end phone available in the market as on date. Even the low light pics were awesome. The Dolby speakers system give a deep and Crystal sound to songs. With android 10 it is a breeze to work on. No lag is visible in any working app be it heavy gaming or office apps. This is a steal in terms of camera, sound, top notch design and best features in the market. Attaching a pic of low light imagery for reference (the light was very low and we were surprised to find the pic clean and not grainy or dim)

"

But, without checking or without resetting products.?Moreover I am unable to return the product.. Still struck with it.

"
1026,3.0 ,"  Keeping the camera and battery life aside, the main part that the device heats up a lot. This happens while charging the phone, while on the call and also while playing a game. I understand its normal that the device heats up but not immediately, as soon as you buy the phone which is new and packed and did not have to privilege to enjoy feel good about the product. I have complained to Amazon and One plus team but still, there is no proper solution. Kindly look into this matter. maybe this product is defective.

"
1027,5.0 ,"  I'm somebody who's switched from an iPhone to OnePlus, back when OnePlus 5 came out. Been very impressed with how that device performed till I've finally again upgraded to OnePlus 7T.

1040,4.0 ,"  Happy with the charging speed. Superfast performance. Very good for gaming. Played Pubg and Call of Duty, didn't observe any frame drops. Although phone gets heated after 15-20 mins. Camera is OK type. Photos looks artificial. Compared with iPhone XR and disappointed with the Camera performance. Macro mode is a good addition though. Bad Amazon after sales. There was a Cash back when I bought, I didn't receive the cash back. Raised a complaint, but nobody called back. 1 Star to Amazon.

"
1042,5.0 ,"  Everything is 5/5. There is no doubt in the mind when the phone is of one plus. Brilliant camera and extended battery life and it comes with a wrap charger that enables you to charge within an hour. Box contains a phone cover and a pre applied glass cover. Dual sim phone with triple camera. There is no cord provided for earphones, so you need to buy a cord from one plus Store and then connect a 3.5 mm earphones or else directly buy wireless earphones for amazing audio quality

"
1043,5.0 ,"  very smooth the best i have used in my life till now, if you want to play PUBG, then you'll be slightly disappointed as you have to use bluetooth earphones but there's delay in bluetooth in sound and video only for the games, as OnePlus has software for syncing audio in videosso the solution is to use wired earphones, using the OnePlus converter from usb c to 3.5mm Jack.

"
1044,4.0 ,"  Went on YouTube, watched 7T vs Iphone 11 and  bought 7T. Why? it's almost half the price with almost equal features. iphone's depreciation is very high if you see.Made a good decision and i am happy.Also, I bought this thing before #boycotChina trend.

"
1045,4.0 ,"  OnePlus 7T has an amazing OSWrap charge is outstandingOn a normal usage at times saw battery drains faster, however, it is better compared to other brandsCamera quality is good, need more improvements in low light environment, wide-angle where the image is disoriented, automatic scene recognization should be made more robustambient light doesnt function well, evengs screen turns yellowish, need a fix for this.

1046,3.0 ,"  Just bought coz of hype...but disappointed.1.camera is ok...but not great.2.refresh rate is good3.poor battery..but charger compensates to some extent.4.face unlock is fast...fingerprint is okay5.slightly heating after long usage...not so ideal for gaming.There are lot of cheaper options available. Will never buy oneplus again.Verdict: Not worth the hype.25k is ideal price for this phone when compared to today's mobiles.

1051,1.0 ,"  I was using 5T for 2 year 9 months and on 7th June 2020, i bought 7T. Even in the 3rd year of usage battery was lasting for 2 days in 5T, whereas the battery is not lasting 1 day in the first week of 7T phone purchase, with similar usage. There is no so called speed, even getting whatsapp messages in the morning when i connect the Net is taking surprisingly lot of time. The hyped up phone charging speed is also lower than 5T. I was a highly satisfied customer with 5T and now thoroughly disappointed.

"
1057,5.0 ,"  One of best phone i have used so far, buttery smooth experience and if you want the best experience under 40k , its the device to go with, only issue is the battery life, i am a sort of a heavy user so the battery drains to fast to my  liking but its ok, another thing is sometimes the ambient display is not working properly, i think its a software bug, oneplus can fix this easily. Overall considering the budget, this is the best phone out there, camera superb, experience superb, display astonishing, I JUST LOVE IT .

Rest performance is very good. Played pubg in full graphics runs very smooth. Display is very good. picture quality is very good. Camera app is buggy. Need to go to service center to get my issue resolved. Please do not update your phone. As camera is bugged after i have updated my phone OS.

"
1062,5.0 ,"  I guess any review won't be enough to describe this piece of beauty by OnePlus.It's top notch.. in almost all aspects..Only little problem is the fingerprint scanner.. it's bit Rusty but it will come around.

"
1063,2.0 ,"  The phone is premium but it doesn't meet the requirement of being a phone. The calls through wifi-calling drops evry time after 15 seconds. The normal calls goes silent for 3 to 5 seconds evry time. There is nothing much excites me apart from build quality. Disappointed for spending 34k. I was always relying on motorola phones for their somplicity and stack android experience. However, lately motorola is producing junk whihc forced me to goto OnePlus 7t. Not sure what to do with this phone.

"
1064,5.0 ,"  The camera, software,  UI (with newer updates like customization) , ultra premium feel, WHOOPINGLY FAST CHARGING SPEED!, ultea smooth processing speeds and fabulous RAM management, 90hz MAKKHAN FEEL ,and host of other features make it 'one of the' (if not 'the' ) best phones in the moderately-high flagships. The only CON that I faced was that at 90hz setting, the battery does not meet expectations AND a little bit of HEATING issues on prolonged heavy usage (in most cases it is gaming).

"
1065,2.0 ,"  1) Battery performance is very bad. battery Drain fast.2)Camera clearity is very poor. I were using the 7 and it have better camera than 7t. when we shoot video in slow-motion in night ata time some lines continues passing through on video.so overall all camera results poor compare to other mobile phone.I have always recommended OnePlus devices to everyone around and had high hopes and trust on the brand that I bought but with this experience, I won't recommend OnePlus 7t to my colleagues and friends who are planning to upgrade their devices.

"
1066,5.0 ,"  Have been using 7T for more than a week now. An awesome product launched by One+, with superb camera quality and inhourse security feature for app. The touch of the phone is super sensitive and really cool.- Camera picture quality is super cool in all modes.- Multiple options to choose the color display pattern- Batter life as of now is good and full charges in less than 30 mins. However, more mAH batter could have been used.- No slot for external SD Card. Though it is 128gb internal memory, more than 26 gb is gone on internal OS only.

"
1067,5.0 ,"  OnePlus 7T is buttery smooth device in this price range with triple camera setup small disappointing OnePlus needs to improve battery backup. But 30T wrap charger is so fast charged 0-to-100% battery within less than an hour, so fabulous. 90hz display is just so good. Dolby Atmos sound quality with surround are very helpful while gaming. Also Oxygen OS with Android 10.0 new gesture become real beast in this competition market.Very excellent device and it's worth it.

"
1068,4.0 ,"  The indisplay fingerprint scanner is amazingly fast and the camera has pretty awesome features, no  60 fps with ultra wide camera, the battery is pretty good but not the best but anyways we have the warp charge 30T that solves the problem. The 90hz completely nails each and every app be it for scrolling the news feed or gaming. My final rating is 9/10 I would go for 10/10 when ultra wide cam features 60fps😁. Software is always up to date and the gaming experience is the best on this phone. Using it from almost 2 months. 8GB 256GB Glacier blue.

"
1069,5.0 ,"  Portraits are excellent.. i have never seen such details and blur in a portrait from any mobile, looks like a dslr shot... Battery is sufficient for me, i have to charge it once in a day but with heavy gaming or in holidays i have to charge it 2 times.... And charging speed is damn awesome... Only thing troubling me is it's oversensitive touch, it registers the touch when finger is 2-3 millimetre above the screen, this thing troubles me while gaming.. hope it would be fixed in some future update

1073,4.0 ,"  I have upgraded from OP3 to OP7T, and it a was a very tough decision to choose from the OP range i.e. 7pro and 7T pro.And since I have been using OP3, camera bump was not an issue but the size of the bump definitely was.Overall it is a great phone at this price range. The top notch is also not an issue as it covers a very less area. Camera quality is awesome, a bit tricky to use at first with lots of option but one will get a hang of it within a day or 2.The phone is definitely handy and sturdy.Battery life is max. 24 hrs.

But now I am facing some issues, sometimes WhatsApp gets hang, photos can't be share on WhatsApp until restart the phone, IRCTC app is not available for this phone.. I am attaching screen video of WhatsApp hanging.. if anyone can help please suggest to solve this problem.Battery charging is good but battery gets discharge soon, on a moderate use battery gets down till evening upto 10% only.Camera quality is very good but above problems are not acceptable.

"
1084,3.0 ,"  Don't know why but the phone is slower than One Plus 6 and also hangs quite a bit. And even the network is an issue. And no it's not the sim card or general network issue. Some issue with the phone itself. And also I think the camera was better on One Plus 6 though this is better on paper. Not really satisfied with the 7t.

With a battery that lasted 7 hours @60 not even 90 refresh rate.To add the battery saver had been on since 20% but it still didn't last.I hope this is a defected piece, because when compared to the 7 with a lower battery capapcity the 7 does brilliantly @60hzAmamzon need a replacement.

"
1088,1.0 ,"  Extremely dissapointed with OnePlus and Amazon. They delivered a phone that gets heated up like a frying pan at first and then replaced it with a phone which started to hang like a cheap phone during the first day itself. Extremely poor quality control. I doubt whether the product is authentic or fake.

"
1089,5.0 ,"  Simply Awesome! I really had a confusin whether to go for Realme X2 Pro or OnePlus 7T. I took a wise decision by going with OnePlus 7T just for it Oxygen OS and for the brand name !* Great Display* Great Camera* Great Battery Life. It charges 70% in just 30 Mins and 0-100% in 53 MintsCons / Which i feel should have made the device better are lack of Headphone Jack & Full Display Screen or a Punch hole camera would have been a great.

1093,4.0 ,"  one plus phone is best i m using it from series 5 bt this one plus 7T is not much more features then 7 so if you want to save some money you can go with one plus 7 only i m sure you will save near 8k and you can invest on best wireless earphone coz no earphone slot is available in one plus variant

"
1094,5.0 ,"  It's a good phone. Not the best out there but it gets the job done. I've had some issues with the battery and the camera is not upto mark as I'd have liked but for 40k I can't complain much. Still miles below the flagship cameras. 90hz display is blazing fast and smoothest ever experience on a smartphone for me yet.. but the battery life I've gotten is just average. I'm a bit heavy user so I have to find my charger twice a day and I'm honestly worried about the longevity of the bettery over time. Hopefully OnePlus rolls out updates to improve battery life. Overall, I'd recommend this phone for smooth performance and decent camera.

Macro mode is my fav thing in the phone. And 90 Hrz display feels like you are moving finger on butter.Only thing I didn't like is battery because of 90 Hrz display it drains faster but for that OnePlus gave us fast charger which will charge your phone in minutes so no complains for that.

"
1101,5.0 ,"  Most affordable and smart phone.One Plus 7T is the best phone I have ever used in my life. Please note my words, Camera performance,display and battery back up is far better than any iPhone series. I have used iPhone for almost 7-8 years but there is no comparison with One Plus 7T. Daylight and even in night mode the Image quality speak it's class. Don't think,just go and purchase and experience it.Please Note: You will get your best image in 1X zoom.

"
1104,3.0 ,"  Finger print reader is very slow, and at times requires multiple attempts. For such a prompt phone they could have given a dedicated hardware.Also battery life is very low, they could have provided a battery with longer life.And Why is the fm radio disabled? Defies all logic, even medium range phones with snap dragon 655 etc.. have it enabled.

1107,5.0 ,"  Upgrading from a Galaxy Note 3 Neo I honestly am getting used to this blazing fast device. It's really smooth and has literally no lag. Smooth transitions between apps, awesome camera, I still can't honestly tell the difference between 90Hz and 60Hz ( fun fact I am not a gamer so i dont understand these refresh rate terms😅) and dash charging which is a huge relief cuz it gives enough juice to run the day in half an hour.

"
1108,4.0 ,"  The overall product is super and is as expected. If one is switching from a regular android phone to one plus for the first time...you can feel the ultra smooth refresh rate of 90hz.And one of the fantastic feel is its fast charging .. U can charge upto 20% in about 7-8mins which is pretty cool.The camera is really cool and overall it's worth buying.Cons : I personally felt battery mAH can be little more than 3800mAH which is pretty low in this range of 35000.

1126,5.0 ,"  I have been using this phone for a month now. This phone is super fast, great speaker, the fluid amoled display is just awesome, haptic engine is decent and oxgen os has always been the best. The only negative point would be the camera, which is good for me as it is decent, but sometimes messes up the quality of photo and the dynamic range a little which won't bother many people. Also what more can you expect at this price point right.

1154,5.0 ,"  The 90Hz display and the processor Snapdragon 855+ that really makes the phone exceptional. The rear camera of the Oneplus7t is compared with Iphone11 pro as you can see there in Youtube. The best Flagship level phone comes under 40K, Dual speakers along with Super Macro mode Oneplus nailed it. As a user of Bluetooth headphones I don't have problem with 3.5mm Jack slot which is not provided by Oneplus. Although Fingerprint sensor and Face unlock is too Fast, Bole to Bawaaal Phone <3 <3

"

"
1158,1.0 ,"  Writing review on the replaced product. First product had a faulty display and hence I got replacement. but now am feeling that old product was better than what I got for second time. Poorest quality phone ever. Camera is not as expected. Image quality and screen resolution is poor. You can observe the grains, pixel scattered, no sharpening of image, overall the quality of the screen resolution is worst. For name sake you have costly mobile phone.

Oneplus must work on this.

"
1167,5.0 ,"  The phone has been brilliant so far. A first OnePlus experience. Best features of the phone has to be the camera and battery life.Easily lasts two days with average usage. On a day with heavy usage, will still end up with a battery of about 30 percent in the night. And Warp 30T is simply no match.The night scape is definitely on par with the premium smart phone (Tested with Samsung and Pixel). And the macro mode can just keep you occupied for hours.

"
1172,5.0 ,"  Pros: Have been using this device over a month. Delighted with the features and performance. Great camera, specially in low lights. Battery is good for medium users, last upto a day. The wrap charger really works fast which can wipe out the not so good battery. The on print fingerprint scanner works fast.Cons: The back cover gets dirty within a month.Overall it is good bet in this budget range.

Only problem I am facing now is the phone is getting restarted without any reason. This is happening from past 4-5 days. Other wise in every perspective this phone is worth to buy.

"
1175,1.0 ,"  Within two weeks phone is HANGING. Screen is slow and needs multiple touch to activate. Fingerprint sensor is painful as it hardly works! Amazon has conveniently passed the buck to Oneplus. Oneplus is not responding. I suspect it's NOT ORIGINAL product.

"
1179,4.0 ,"  Good phone for the price. You get latest chipset + 8gb ram + 90hz fluidic display. Only concern is battery backup if you use too many apps on the go, else it will suffice for the generic user. 30W warp charging is super fast and bumps your battery to almost 90 % in matter of 25-30 mins.

"
1220,1.0 ,"  I purchased oneplus 7t  and my camera stopped working after 14days. I have tried doing everything including factory reset but my camera won't work. This is definitely a defective product. Going to the service center in this covid situation when the phone is not even a month old is ridiculous . The worst service by Amazon and seller .How can you expect someone to service their phone in less than a month . No redressal yet.

"
1221,5.0 ,"  Screen unlock using fingerprint and face unlock is fast enough, much better than other smartphones. The speakers are louder than most of the flagships. The camera quality was not up to the mark as of what I had expected but not bad at this price range. Also the battery life is good but 90hz refresh rate consumes more power but the warp charge 30T is there to get your device ready within 30mins. Overall it's the best smartphone in the market with everything needed.

"
1222,5.0 ,"  Excellent and satisfied with this mobile. Charging speed is great. The only cons is the camera doesn't do well with the dynamic range - details are not accurate and missing in the shadows. But that's not a problem for overall picture quality... Worth buying.

"
1223,5.0 ,"  Excellent phone and Clear and Smooth Oxygen OS you can give 38000 for the Smooth ad free Oxygen OS need to improve portrait photo.Camera is good but needs improvements.The display is good,not excellent.

"
1224,3.0 ,"  There are minor bugs, like sometime screen remain on even if setting is set to off screen after 30 sec inactivity. Issue resolve after reboot but it again appear after one-two days.Data on SIM 2 is not working properly, I made sure it is not sim issue. I tested with same networks and on SIM 1 it is working fine and same time it cause issue on SIM 2. Again after reboot it work fine.Not expected from OnePlus 😔

"
1225,5.0 ,"  Battery will last for atleast 24hrs with moderate usage. Camera is pretty good. Display is awesome. Build quality is good. The design on the back is really good. Charges really fast. It's a very good package for 35k.

"
1226,5.0 ,"  Well I am a freak when it comes to gadgets, but I am astonished and satisfied with my new OnePlus 7T. The camera is module is the one that took away my heart. The battery life is less compared to other phones available in the market but again the charging time is also less hence it doesn't make a big difference. I love the phone and must say that it is indeed a great phone. People .ight have other opinion, it depends.

"
1227,1.0 ,"  Worst phone by OnePlus ever. Lagging and freezing like hell. Fingerprint sensor placed inside the screen works like shit and appears whenever we are typing something also (even when I typed this review). Open more than 3 apps phone lags and slows down. Battery life is shit not even withstanding 12 hrs.

"
1228,2.0 ,"  Oneplus 7t..  m not happy with this series...  and it has a problem with whatsp and Instagram... Most of the times 3rd party apps will not work.. OnePlus cares saying still wtsp and Instagram not updated their app to Android 10... It's been 10 over after release of Android 10 I DNT know what to say....This phone has fast process... M not denying it.. but not happy with 3rd party application..

"
1229,2.0 ,"  Phone started hanging within 3 days of use .I switched off and restart to solve the issue .but it was not expected from one plus .back cover and screen guard is really pathetic .

1230,3.0 ,"  I am the first user of OnePlus.not much better than the poco f1.10 days of usage nothing found better options in this phone.camera quality also not much that OnePlus 6 I checked with my friend phone.also getting heat some times. I never seen heat in my previous phone of Poco f1 since 1 year usage.

"
1231,5.0 ,"  Based on my usage of 2 months, this is the best flagship phone. Best camera. Sometimes portrait doest work as per the expectations and damages the photo as well it was only once it happened with me. Overall the performance is good processor is high end. No heating issues till now.

"
1232,1.0 ,"  Worst phone ever!!!!!It's been 6 months and it's heating like hell!!!Draining battery really fast, and the Warp charger doesn't works!!!!40k gone in vain!!!!I don't complain if it heats at the time of gaming, I can understand that but it's heating with normal use, even if I watches a video, just unlock the phone and it's start burning!!!!

"
1233,3.0 ,"  The phone probably was used by somebody, on second day noticed the cover had paint scratched...the blue color was faded revealing the metal .I had the phone covered with the cover came with the phone. For so much of cost, atleast give us headphones!!!Charging is great...its phenomenal, battery life is average!

"
1234,1.0 ,"  The phone has very poor camera quality. There are network issues while calling, which are unrelated to the Service provider. Calls keep getting interrupted. There is very poor repair service, the repair requests for one plus are not immediately looked after by the company. 10 days into buying this phone and it has already been sent for repair, of which the company has still not provided receiving/repair confirmation.

"
1235,5.0 ,"  I had to think many times regarding which one to choose as a replacement for note 7 pro. After lots of comparisons and suggestions had decided to go with this premium phone. I am very much Happy to choose this.Camera performance is awesome.Screen quality is absolutely amazing.Sound quality is great.Performance of the phone is very great. You can operate multiple apps and still you can feel very smooth performance.Warp charger charges the mobile in quick time.

"
1236,3.0 ,"  First ever experience with OnePlus. Not very much happy. Back camera quality is awesome but when it comes to wide angle, the picture quality is too bad. Phone is getting heated so much that my cover color changed in few weeks. Bought phone on Oct 9. See how much heat generated that changed my default cover color :(

"
1237,4.0 ,"  Using since last 6 months.Battery capacity is okay, not so great but fast charging compensates. OnePlus series has always been value for money phone. Sometimes it heats when playing heavy games. I also noticed ,sometime it gets hang.

"
1238,5.0 ,"  ""This thing is blazzzzing fast"".. I'm not discusing about each specs here, as you already know. But the experience you get with this device is next level and absolutely worthy. I was in a great dilemma between Galaxy S10 lite & OP7T but I choose OnePlus over Samsung and I'm not even regreting but enjoying my device. This phone is really addictive. Thanks OnePlus for creating this amazing machine.

"
1239,4.0 ,"  Amazing product from one plus budget friendly and great specs, the fingerprint sensor is not as good as I thought it would be and pictures clicked seem to feel more enhanced than what it usually is compared to pictures taken from an iPhone

"
1240,5.0 ,"  Only drawback the phone has is 3800mh battery apart from that the phone is excellent and super fast. the parallel aap feature is better here than samsung.camera quality is very good, and the phone performance is top notch given the 8gb ram size. with such great features i dont know why one plus did not increase the battery size?

"
1241,4.0 ,"  Phone is greatTwo pointsBattery life is not as good as advertised . With moderate use it drains to 30 % within 9 hours after its 100%The finger print reader  is too sensitive and takes time to read finger impressionCamera is good

"
1242,4.0 ,"  The phone is snappy enough that you won't feel using any other phone after this. The default camera is good. But i recommend using Google camera port from XDA developers. The battery life must be improved. I get around 5 to 5.5 hours of screen on time with 90hz turned on. Camera needs to be improved.

"
1243,5.0 ,"  Amazing phone. The best in the market in it's range. Got the 8GB RAM and 256GB storage model. The display is too good with 90hz refresh. Very fast display and Dolby Atmos sound. The sound clarity is very good and loud to watch movies. Beats all the iphones and Samsung of the world in terms of value. The build quality gets a rating of 5. Camera gets rating of 5.

"
1244,5.0 ,"  This phone is a complete package if there ever was one. The Facial recognition is superb at any angle, the refresh rate of the screen is truly worth the upgrade it is not as fast as the gaming phones like Black Shark or RoG phone but definitely better than most high end Smartphones.Fingerprint sensor is super fast as well. There is very little lag and the camera is exceptional, with great colour saturation.

"
1245,5.0 ,"  Pros/Cons1) Like its camera the most.2) Super Speed and smooth.3) Fingerprint sensor is fast but sometimes itfails to recognise.4) Battery life has reduced considerably after last two OS upgrades.

"
1246,3.0 ,"  Am big fan of OnePlus oxygen devices but am not satisfied with finger print. Couple of issues makes unhappy with this device.Even after doing trouble shooting with tech support process, still issue remains same.

"
1247,2.0 ,"  Not worthy phone. It hangs while using. I didn't expect this with the phone. Bought One Plus first time with great specifications 8GB+265GB still such issues. System memory takes about 28-30 GB space and my media files consumed about 35 GB as of now and file systems shows to delete images and other files for smooth experience. How come after having 256 GB memory phone while using just 65GB space it slows down. Even I didn't download a single game.

"
1248,5.0 ,"  Phone is good, 90hz display is good, camera is also quite good.Cons1. Battery life is short and 90hz takes a lot of battery.2. Slow motion inside room flickers a lot.3. No headphone jackTipIf on long drive and using map on this phone , use it in night mode else the battery will die even if you are charging it.

"
1252,4.0 ,"  Good phone overall, camera is not VERY great, but it's pretty decent for everyday use. Touchscreen is good, fingerprint sensor is pretty fast. I hardly have any issues with it. The only thing is the 90Hz display- It's beautifully smooth but drains ALOT of battery. You can use it only if you have a charger near you all the time. Switched to 60Hz, battery lasts a full day use. Good fast charging

"
1253,5.0 ,"  7T fingerprint reader is an excellent, better than iphone7, Good battery, The Warp charger superb,Good Camera, but not meet the expectations like other 7T futures, & the built quality of land markI'm a fan of Samsung, but One plus change my mind.

"
1255,4.0 ,"  I like everything about this phone. It's a big step up from the previous version. Only thing I find a bit annoying is the extra long dimensions and circular housing for the triple cameras. It's the most value for money phone for the price at this point of time.

"
1256,5.0 ,"  Phone is very smooth and premium.90 Hz refresh rate is very nice and display is classy.Oxygen OS is fantastic.Camera quality is best in Class. But check for YouTube reviewers videos and user reviews before buying this device.Overall best flagship phone in the market.

"
1262,5.0 ,"  Personally I like the phone very much. The color OS and camera are excellent. 90 Hz, give smooth working. Only the issue found in Battery life, for a good mobile user, will get for one day. The charging is very fast which will overcome the issue, but anyhow the battery to be 4000 mAh+. Overall, I am satisfied with the product and recommended it. Here I am attaching some pics which I took with the camera.

"
1263,5.0 ,"  Except for a few bugs while using Whatsapp, The phone is smooth and fast! Battery lasts a full day with heavy usage and thanks to the fast charger, I don't charge my phone overnight anymore. Camera is capable and love the shots with the macro lens. The price is on a bit higher side but the phone always felt it's worth the money. Overall, recommended.

"
1264,1.0 ,"  On 6th June, I have received a defective phone and is not switching on. I have requested replacement and today delivery boy rejected delivery as the old phone is not switching on and he wants to check IMEI number. Finally I have cancelled my order just now. And I am worrying that what I have to do if the pickup boy also say the same thing like I have to switch on and check the IMEI number.

"
1265,5.0 ,"  Been using this beast for over a month... Definitely a monster in terms of performance. Camera quality is great and speakers are loud enough. Though found some bugs like notification panel stuck on the top and you have to lock the screen and unlock again and it happens hardly 1 out of 1000 times but received an update and I think it's fixed now..Would definitely recommend this beast.

"
1268,5.0 ,"  Awesome phne....worth spending ...a real flag ship phne......just a pin point worry that it doest have head phne jack.....they should include a original converter in this pack....i think that could not cost much...but buying out side covert which may damage the socket in future will be better to have original one, bcoz gaming exp like pub g have pin point accuracy with headphne rather than using a bluetooth head phne......that is the only worry with this phne...else all things r excelent....9 out of 10.

1273,5.0 ,"  I previously had a One Plus 3, it lasted me 3 years and now I've bought a One Plus 7T and it is amazing. Be it the battery life, the camera, the speed, the display everything... A no brainer if you are considering to buy a phone in this price range!

"
1274,1.0 ,"  Well disgusting feeling when you feel that the device have a issue of conference call, sometime it works and sometime it wont.I believe it's the issue with Amazon they have a tie-up with people who don't provide proper devices or issue wala device.I strongly recommend to think twice because one plus don't provide proper customer support also...A week now no reply no one received calls or text.

"
1275,5.0 ,"  After watching almost all the video on YouTube I decided to buy this phone . That too considering the launch of the 8 series. if you would ask me then 7t is much more better than the 8.

"
1277,1.0 ,"  Highly over rated phone.Not durable at all. I have ha bit of using phone  without any cases and this phone just got damaged in 1 drop. When I was using Samsung, despite I dropped that phone on concrete road, it kept working for more than 1 year and without any protection gear. However, 1+ not even handled a drop inside house floor.

1287,4.0 ,"  I switched from old iPhone to 1+ - don't have too much regret . At this price point I found this phone to be value for money.- if any iPhone user has to complain he must complain about Android not about capability of 1+.- overall I am happy with my selection.- 1+ u deserve it .- one star not given bcoz of they didn't provide headphone & headphone jack 🤗

"
1288,4.0 ,"  It's a beast in terms of performance, not missing my iPhone. Camera bump is a bit of a downer and the screen guard and backcases which come with the phone take aways it's luxury feeling, so you might wanna invest in that! The fast charging is insane while the display is almost too good. Sound output is clear. No lags in any of the heavy duty games. Not a big fan of the gestures. All in all worth the price.

"
1289,5.0 ,"  The phone's way too fast and smooth to use.Never seen a camera quality like this before way too natural pictures.Guys just go for the phone and as the company claims.....Never settle.One recent problem I'm facing is with WhatsApp whenever I attach any image it hangs.Still don't understand the problem is with WhatsApp or the phone.

1291,5.0 ,"  Previously I am using OnePlus 5t. Comparing to that this feels heavy and bulky. For previous oneplus users,  can't find any special in 90 Hz display. But battery drains faster. Camera quality improved. 6gb or 8gb both are equal for regular users. But storage matters.

"
1292,4.0 ,"  Lazy Delivery by amazon and the case sent in the box with mobile....... I am not able to use gestures due to the protective case but naked it'll work perfectly. Performance of the mobile is awesome and Camera is not so OP because it supports only 12 MP of the rear instead of 42...... You have to install third party app like google cam for that 42 MP.

"
1293,5.0 ,"  Simply brilliant!!Games, music, performance etc. everything working well!I just expect Oneplus to atleast provide Bullets headphones free with this 7T.

"
1295,5.0 ,"  Got it on discounted price with SBI offer. Thanks to amazon for timely delivery. Super smooth display, fast charging, good crisp sound and above all stock android like oxygen OS. Camera is also good as compare to lower versions of oneplus. Only 1 drawback which is non availability of 3.5 MM jack.

1311,4.0 ,"  So far so good and they would have increased battery life to 4200 mah as it is 90hz refrsh rate.Currently getting screen on time of 5 hours and if you play games screen on time is 4 hours(100-0)Apart from that no other concerns. all looks perfect.

"
1312,4.0 ,"  The overall phone is good for the money you keep. You get a decent camera, marvelous performance, battery life shouldn't be a problem with the Warp charge 30t that you get in the box. It's just very fast.But putting all the good things aside. I hate to say this. But it's not the perfect phone. The display has a greenish tint on the top half of the display at low brightness. Hope oneplus can solve this with a software update!

"
1313,5.0 ,"  Coming from iPhone I was a bit skeptical of Android but this phone is just unbelievable. Ultra smooth and fast. Camera is just way too good although sometimes a bit too saturated but a software update is incoming for that too.Battery life is insane , I easily get 7 hours of screentime with 90hz display on, high end usage and gaming. To top that off it charges for the whole day in just about 40-50 mins too. Best I have ever used

"
1314,5.0 ,"  The phone is really fast with awesome diplay and the SD855+ really makes a difference in speed.Good for gaming and other high perfomance tasksCamera was just ok was not as expected.Battery backup is good the charging speed is amazing

"
1315,3.0 ,"  Felt so much excited after getting the phone..I felt really funny that WhatsApp hangs sometimes,Prime Video and Netflix gets errors because of highly advanced software of One Plus or whatever don't really understand! This is a highly dissatisfaction I'm having right now,as it's not even 2 months hardly I have received this mobile..Think before going for this

"
1316,5.0 ,"  The product is too good. Specially the charging. Though battery life would last for a day but its charger makes it so easy that you dont need to worry about battery. Features are too good and smooth functioning. Overall I'm happy to buy this product.

"
1317,5.0 ,"  One of the best smartphones in the market, even I would say it is the best of them. I will not write here much about the phone The people who are well aware about OnePlus will love it definitely.After purchase, I had a payment related issue with Amazon and my bank but the service provided by Amazon and the solutions provided by them were excellent.Highly recommended!

"
1318,5.0 ,"  Reviewing it after one month of use. Moving from an iPhone 6s to a OnePlus i had my reservations. But i think i love this phone more than I ever loved the iPhone. It's blazingly fast, takes great pics (awesome for the price) and charges like a thunderbolt!

"
1319,5.0 ,"  This is such an amazing phone with a beast like specifications and top end built-in design. Seriously with that huge camera setup photography seems to be quite natural and real like feel . The optimization (sink) between the hardware and software shows the real character of the built in code. Many phone use the same sony imx cameras but the picture quality varies from others to oneplus. Oxygen OS is the real plus to this phone . Believe me it works better than stock android.

"

1323,1.0 ,"  Poor camera

"
1324,3.0 ,"  It's very sad to hear that you guys don't provide one 3.5 mm Jack splitter for your new products.. and the not so late OnePlus 7t should have been come with the spillter like u provided for the OnePlus 6T. Feels sad being a loyal customer since I was using OnePlus 3

"
1325,5.0 ,"  First impression is good. What I liked the most is battery life. Runs more than a day and charge upto 50% in few minutes. In day to day this really comes handy.Second the camera. Portrait mode and micro gave great photos. Initially had screen stability issue for slow motion video but that got fixed in patch update.Display is really great. Audio is ok.Happy for every penny spend.

"
1326,5.0 ,"  It doesn't make any sense to buy this when OnePlus 8 series is outI have been using it since 8 months,Still at its best performanceBattery is average but 30wt charger compensates for that

"
1327,5.0 ,"  Just loved it.But there are some glitches in Android 10!Rest OnePlus is love❤️, it's a masterpiece with an amazing camera, a smooth display and a beautiful Dolby Atmos 2.1 sound which is very loud.It's a go! Worth every penny.

"
1328,5.0 ,"  Camera:100Battery:75Processing:100For better battery life use your phone on 60hz refresh rate.Gameplay is very smoother.Oxygen OS is just what u want.Customization is fantastic.

"
1329,4.0 ,"  It is an excellent phone but there is some issues with it also. Like it heats up sometimes, camera stopped responding sometime. When you are using camera to take pictures it freezes or blank screen appears and when you try to reopen the camera, it doesn't not open. I think there is some software issues with camera function.One pus must really acknowledge this issue as it is the only measure issue with this phone.

"
1330,5.0 ,"  After all Mobile is very good but camera is not good which I have expected from one plus 7T series..Selfie camera is very bad .Wrap charge is very nice ..I was using Samsung A7 before but selfie camera was too good at that mobile...Fingerprint reader is awesomePrimary camera is good ..Second space option is not good ...In this price I can get more better ....3 out of 5

"
1331,5.0 ,"  Best phone of the year overall performance of this phone is above expectation. Camera quality is perfect battery life is good and fingerprint reader is also good. Over points out of 10 i wud say 9, as the jack is not being given in the phone, is a bit disappointing but overall the phone is nothing less then a good combo of specifications

"
1332,5.0 ,"  Received in 1 day delivery. Good looking phone slightly elongated but amazing experience when you use it. Smith as butter while swiping throw Facebook and other apps. Good audio and video as expected. Better then 1+ 7 and pro also rog2 in terms of long term usage and durability.

"
1333,4.0 ,"  Improved in all areas comparative to earlier models. Few concerns are in design where the camera space can be redesigned instead of pertruding and also the weight factor can be balanced better.Other wise best android phone right now in the market.

"
1334,5.0 ,"  Exchanged 3T for this new upgrade.Worth the buy and a handy upgrade.Camera quality is superb.Battery life is great also warp charging is as per expectations.I did not like the cover though. The case is not suiting the phone design or colour.

"
1335,5.0 ,"  Since recieved 2 days back so I can not say much but looks very appealing,good camera.i have to order 3.5 mm adapter separately ,it should be in sales package by One plus.phone was sealed pack but little but dissatisfied with Amazon Packing.

Price is to high whereas same featires are innlow price. advantages1. super speed2. Phone style is new look3. Fast sensor of finger print4. Camera day time superOverall best phone.

"
1337,4.0 ,"  I was using an iPhone 6s before I moved to this new incredible device. Guys, I am in love with it. It's very blazingly fast and better than speed of iPhone. Only problem that I have is with the camera (sometimes captures blurry images) but rest everything is great and you can go for it.

"
1338,5.0 ,"  This Phone is crossed all levels of Awesomeness. I was using OnePlus 5t earlier. Exchanged it with 7T and got a great discount. Wonderful offers by Amazon. I feel safe and secure whenever I am ordering from Amazon. Phone Box was little bit in wrong structure but inside all was okay. I would recommend to buy this Phone from Amazon only. You will get great offers. Thank you Amazon!!!

"
1339,1.0 ,"  Worst phone with lot of heating issues. Forget about PUB G even if you use camera for 5 mins it heats up. Battery drains fast. Low end phones perfoms much better than such third class phone.Picture quality pathetic. Camera is poor.Better to buy low budget phones.There are posotive points but it fails at basic level features only.A BIG MISTAKE TO BUY THIS PHONE

"
1340,4.0 ,"  Though only 1 day if using this one, but I found it great. Smooth and efficient ...One plus at its best... Amazon did deliver within 48 hrs and exchanged my older One plus 5..good job... Let's see n fewer days how's things go but as of now it's definitely a buy guys

"
1341,5.0 ,"  Camera quality- awesomeBattery life- excellentProcesser- very fastDesign- mind blowingSound quality- very goodGo for it because it is very awesome at this reasonable price. Excellent in each every aspect. Really very glad to have product like this. Using one plus series from long time ago and very satisfied with all series. Go for it without any doubt.

"
1342,4.0 ,"  I have been using this phone less than two months and i facing issue with  charging it suddenly stoped charging and  the dealer is not responding and they did not display the customer care no ....i have very bad experience with Amazon and seller.

"
1343,5.0 ,"  Everything works just good. Nothing outstanding.Fingerprint reader sometimes doesn't work properly. Battery life is a bit weak.Safe phone to buy.

"
1344,5.0 ,"  It's a butter device! ❤️And my first flagship phone.🥰Could've done much better with the battery segment!But at the end of the day the warp charger provided with the handset is the life savior .Seriously no other handset can beat the smoothness of flagship phones like OnePlus and iphone! Love you 1+

"
1345,3.0 ,"  First of all this phone is far inferior to previous versions. Battery life is very poor. Phone hangs almost every day and restarts several time.  Bluetooth has big problem. It can't connect to many of the available bluetooth.I am a fan of one plus and this is big disappointment. Rather previous version 5t and 6t are much better.

"
1346,1.0 ,"  Such an defective phone. It's lagging so badly and I am not even able to use it because of these many issues like camera stop working in between then I'll have to restart it. Watsapp and Instagram isn't working . Not able to attach files. I have tried to attach video in reveiw but even that is not working

"
1347,4.0 ,"  I used this about 25 day's i want to share my experience about dis device.The phone quality is really good (gorrila glass)The quality of camera is really osum👻Battery capacity nice,dash charger is not woried uThe performance is gud without lagI luv OnePlus device about the UI(oxygen os) simply butter smooth. I recommend to buy dis mobile guys

"
1348,4.0 ,"  As per specification the phone is value for money.However I read the tech specs somewhere that it can record 960 fps videos.The slow motion recording is max at 480 fps. It flickers a lot. I just hope a software upgrade is needed to improve this. If it can then it can give competition to Samsungs Note phones.

"
1349,5.0 ,"  Excellent.Ultrafast, Superb Display, Excellent battery backup (5 hrs 38 min SOT), Excellent camera quality, Excellent dual speaker quality(Very very clear and loud enough), Very nice earpiece speaker quality , Excellent charging time (0-100% in 1hr), Very fast software updates from OnePlus. I can't find any single compaint in this phone.I am posting this review after using this for 20 days.

"
1350,5.0 ,"  90Hz refresh rate works like butter. Its a good to go phone at this price range. Sure there is a battery issue if you compare it with rog phone 2 but it works fine for average gaming and hardcore video watching (online/offline). It gives me an average of 7-8 hours of SOT and 20 hours of full charge time. If you are not a hardcore gamer, this is a good(not best) phone at this price range. If you are, better go for 6000mAh asus rog phone 2.

"
1351,5.0 ,"  90Hz Screen is the real highlight. Everything is just butter smooth. ❤️Tripple camera, especially wide angle & macro mode is super fun to use.Gaming is A1 - COD runs brilliantly.But again, that screen. It steals the show.

"
1352,1.0 ,"  Poor built quality.fell frm just 1 ft. and its display got damaged.

"
1353,5.0 ,"  Everything in this phone is good except for average battery, so i had to go back to 60 Hz refresh rate to cope up with that and it really increased the battery backup and because of excellent oxygen OS I couldn’t tell any difference between 90 and 60 Hz, So it’s there as a choice, but I don’t think anyone will use 90 Hz.Apart from this everything is excellent in this phone.

"
1354,5.0 ,"  Everything about this phone is pretty awesome. Photo quality, micro mode, wide angle everything is superb.Con:Only problem I face is sometimes the volume automatically changed to full while listening song or playing games.

"
1355,3.0 ,"  Here's my honest review 2020Well i get this product at ₹32750  coz offers were going onAt this price segment this phone is just magnificent though, had some cons- you find too many bugs- battery efficiency is not that satisfactory  for me- display i find some flicker during use- if you are selfie lover this phone is not for you- for pros go on YouTube

"
1356,5.0 ,"  Really a good buy, screen is very smooth to use. Good camera quality.Pros: display 90 hz, 855+, small notch on front, charging speedCons: weight is 190 which feel heavy, no wireless charging, no QHD, bigger screen who loves below 6 inches. price would have below 30k.Overall good one and cant compliant too much.CheersVenkatesh

"
1357,5.0 ,"  Fingerprint reader is very quick as always, camera could be much better by the way OnePlus always releases camera updates later on to improve it. it's screen with 90hz is very awesome and buttery smooth which leads to little less battery life than usual and that problem is overcome by warpcharge 30t that you won't even feel battery issue. Overall it's a great phone.

"
1358,5.0 ,"  This is best phone of this generation, Snapdragon 855+ is doing it's justice, and not to forget the camera quality let it be nightscape, pro mode or video it is the best, there is no clear comparison to OnePlus 7T..!! I'm ""Super Loving"" it..!!

"
1359,5.0 ,"  First things first....the display is like fluid flowing in a screen. turning on dark mode helps to experience the fluid amoled feature of these mobile. coming to camera ....the macro mode and portrait mode were stunning and mind-blowing.The battery seems to be less efficient but it's ok to me...as I'm a moderate gamer. I've included some macro shots of these mobile. You can check my insta profile ssandeep_498.

"
1360,5.0 ,"  You'll get addicted to this phone pretty soon. Because it's soo much smooth. Camera Quality is pretty awesome. Battery life is great. Processor is totally making it heads up for all buyers. Go for it.

"
1361,5.0 ,"  After 2month of usage.. Outstanding os.. Thats y i pick it  over the x2 pro. And good camera still below the pixel and iphone.. After some upadates shows some good results.. Excellent performance.. But battery is avg.. If u are a gamer(gaming performance is awsome no laggimg till now) and need some battery then go for x2pro or rog

"
1362,1.0 ,"  Sensor issue and charger overheat issue not resolved by company and during return period they send technical guy but they said Its software issue and not phone problem. Now after 10 days no one is listening. Really wasted 38000 on this phone.

"
1363,5.0 ,"  After using it for two months I can proudly say that this phone is just amazing and worth every penny spent.Camera quality is superb specifically the nightscape mode and the phone in general is very smooth and fast.The only drawback is the battery, it could have been a little bigger. Need to charge my phone twice in 24 hours with heavy usage.

"
1364,4.0 ,"  Disappointed with battery life. Lost for 20 hours with very less usage. Heats up more than OnePlus 3t. We can boil water with that heat

"
1365,4.0 ,"  Best Android phone ever. Couldn't ask for more, Love it. But not satisfied with the battery back up. Lasts upto 5 hours when used continuously. Camera is amazing as all the features works exactly as mentioned. Charges at high speed. Fingerprint sensor is pretty good too.

"
1366,4.0 ,"  Good phone but on a little heavier side. Battery backup is not that too great. 90 hrtz screen is a battery sucker. Doesn't even last a full day. Just a ok phone nothing very special or great about it. Was expecting a wow experience as it's a flagship & after spending 40kb- which is missing. That's missing for sure. Though, frosted sliver color looks awesome.v

"
1367,5.0 ,"  Very fast screen refresh. large display. Enjoyed the  camera  - took some  holiday  pics  in  slow motion, came out great. Powerful processor - no  hangs so far.

"
1368,5.0 ,"  The best mobile till now I have used ..But only problem with this mobile is Battery life... When u charge your mobile upto 100% in the morning 9am ,by the 8pm you have to charge your mobile based on usage so if you are a heavy user you have to use the mobile in the 60Hz display and have to turn on the battery saver so that you can use extra 2hrs. Other than battery life the mobile is best mobile on budget between 30k-35k

"
1369,5.0 ,"  Dont go for battery derain problem...i am using this phone and battery backup so good if u are a gamer u use approx 5..6 hour continue gaming and normally  abot a day battery backup....and also 30t warp charger...my phone charge 70% in 35 min approx...so fast charge...and performance...i cant explain...must buy..

"
1370,5.0 ,"  A great phone in this budget. I have used OnePlus 6 and this upgrade to 7 is amazing. It's really fast and great for playing games like COD.Battery backup is also good but be cautious while playing games. It eats uo the battery if you are playing a game in high resolution.

1376,5.0 ,"  It is a very smooth phone with no lag.the camera quality is good.the only disappointment was not getting earphones with such an expensive phone.speakers are very good and sound quality overall is superb.definitely worth a buy

"
1377,5.0 ,"  First time OnePlus user...and man it was butterly smooth just like the 90 hz refresh rate screen... OnePlus has left no stones unturned in producing this beast...from the hardware aspects to the camera..from battery to aesthetics.. everything is covered mind blowingly.... earlier a poco user..it was also a flagship killer but this one is truly a flagship..u have to own it to feel it...

"
1378,5.0 ,"  This phone is just too good.I was worried about the battery life before using this phone. But it's absolutely unbelievable. You only need to charge this phone once in 24 hours. Warp charging makes life easier too.The camera quality and processing is amazing as well.Real happy customer here, thank you Oneplus!

"
1385,5.0 ,"  It's been a couple of days I am using this phone. the Battery life could have been better, not sure since the place I stay does not have good network probably because of which the battery is draining soon in search of network.

"
1387,3.0 ,"  It was a very disappointing experience with Amazon. I tried to replace the device but there is no way I can do that, Amazon is saying that talk to 1+ and device customer care saying that talk to Amazon. It's not more than a week since I made this purchase and the device is heating up like lava and lagging prime functions and is getting hanged whenever I unlock

"
1388,5.0 ,"  I was a oneplus 3 user. Used it for 3.5 years, I had decided to stick to oneplus! Was confused between 7 & 7T , but trust me 7T is worth the extra penny. It's a beast of a phone and don't waste ur money on 7 pro or 7t pro, they are just a marketing gimmic. 7T is an overall package.

I hope oneplus can fix it in next software updates !!Sound and video clarity is simply awesome.

"
1397,1.0 ,"  I am facing lot of issues with this flagship phone from OnePlus. It is a defective phone that I received. I have used OnePlus 3T earlier and it was a very good phone but I am really disappointed by this 7T. OnePlus should do something about the performance of the phones considering the price. They are just flooding the market with low quality phones now.

"
1398,5.0 ,"  Insane. Pure class from OnePlus.Best quality display in the market, best quality performance in the market, sound quality is also good, cameras are decent, battery life is also great gives you over 6 hours of sot and don't even get me started on the charging speeds. The charger in the box charges completely from 0 to 100 in just an hour. What more do you want in a smartphone?

"
1406,5.0 ,"  Oxygen OS too smooth, camera is okayish, phone charging really quick, battery life-on screen time from 100 to 0 around 7-8 hours on 90Hz display but more standby time lesser on screen time. Auto brightness is below average most of the times it is set to very low brightness and needs to be manually done but I hope they can improve this over software updates.

"

"

1414,5.0 ,"  I am very happy to have OnePlus 7T it gives u the smooth experience of screen with 90 hz refresh rate ,it's amazing! THE FLUID AMOLED DISPLAY !Camera is the best in this segmentOnly battery backup is less but it easily can give you 6-7 hrs of full usage with 90hz and with moderate usage can go for next day as well .MUST GO FOR IT

"
1415,2.0 ,"  It's hangs in the initial days but after few updates its working fine.apart from cam and front finger print I don't think there is much upgrade. My one plus 6T is equally good. There should be significant upgrade from previous model's

"
1416,4.0 ,"  It's a great phone with an amazing performance and display. It has an almost upto mark camera (can be improved in later updates) and the quality is fascinating. Battery life is not as good even though it's 3,800 mAh I still charge it thrice a day (also I am not heavy phone user). Overall, I am having a great experience with the phone.

"
1419,4.0 ,"  The phone is pretty fast and looks premium. However battery life is not up to the mark. Also for the price of Rs.35000, it is not value for money as it does not even give bragging rights like apple and samsung flagship phones. In comparison, Redmi K2  Pro is far better.

"
1425,1.0 ,"  This is worth less phone at this price point. My last phone was 1+6 and it was much better than 1+7t. Quality wise, camera wise n performance was 1+6 is the best. I think I got defective handset and gallery images look blurr and creat problem when you would like to share any image to someone. Phone heating and hanging issue at this price point.

"
1435,5.0 ,"  An amazing phone after 2 months of use. Great camera for this price. Night shots could be a bit more better. Battery is good, however not being a gamer I am not the right person to comment on battery life. Fingerprint reader is fast and accurate more than 95 percent of the time. Extremely good phone for almost half the price of the top iPhone in the market.

"
1436,5.0 ,"  It is a good purchase till now.I really liked how oxygen os has been operating.It's very very smooth , no lag while playing intense games , easy to handle the multitasking.The rear snappers are quite good too.The only demerit I think was front snapper which could have been better during artificial lighting conditions.

"
1629,5.0 ,"  apart from a glitch in delivery of this product, everything's just right. Easily my best phone since 2002. The best feature is how quickly it gets charged & how long it's stays so.

"
1633,5.0 ,"  As a iPhone user since years, I really like the performance of the phone, the fingerprint reader is very smooth and fast, the camera quality is good and with 30w charger the phone is able to charge 0% to 70% about an half an hour. The only con is there is no notification light for alert, due to which we may miss the calls and notification

"
1634,1.0 ,"  The worst phone in terms of security. Hello dear, I am using one plus 7t. A huge bug that I found in this device is the lock unlock of the phone. When unlocking the device it ask for fingerprint sensor to be touched but got unlocked with just swiping it up. The manual code option doesn't appear while doing this and phone is simply getting unlocked.

"
1635,5.0 ,"  Writing the review after 4 days of use. Design and colour were very nice. Regarding camera, Image quality was excellent, potrait mode was too good. But I have observed a slight colour change of images. Oxygen OS was very simple and easy to use. We can feel the very smooth experience because of 90 hz display.

"

"
1647,3.0 ,"  Decent phone but not something that will keep you a league ahead, specially what Oneplus used to do earlier.Should have been priced properly. Customer experience and Oxygen OS is a plus definitely.Wait for OP8 or OP8T make sence.

"
1651,5.0 ,"  I had multiple options available for buying a phone. Before OnePlus 7t, I was using OnePlus 6t. The feel of this phone is amazing! & The camera quality is at its best.. 7t has better touch, camera ofcourse and the standard oneplus features which I feel is the best in android. Worth it.

"
1652,5.0 ,"  Excellent budget phone with a great Ui. Triple camera is better than 6t and amoled display is something one plus should have added in earlier models. Overall a great phone bought for my wife. She loves it. Thanks Amazon.

"
1654,5.0 ,"  Well it's a complete package, the stock camera is pretty impressive and the highlights are the super macro mode and the 🌃 scape modes. The 90hz refresh rate smoothens your scrolling experience but at the same time draining the juices of your 7t.The charging rates are pretty insane.Value for buck and loving the oxygen os.First experience with OnePlus and loving it.

"
1657,2.0 ,"  It's a very good phone with all the latest features. Camera is superb. But only problem is the screen, it has fluid display, which is very fragile. Any small scratch or breakage in the glass causes the fluid to leak and complete display is useless. So I feel OnePlus shall stop using fluid screens.

"
1658,5.0 ,"  Mobile looking good, performing good. Totally satisfied. Display clarity, sound clarity superb. For normal usage battery comes one and half day.

"
1697,1.0 ,"  Mobile had little bit of dirt on screen and fingerprint marks on the camera. Not sure how how it can be since its a new unit. Anyhow when I switched it on, I was surprised to see a vertical line on left side of the display. I immediately packed it back and called amazon. A technician will visit and then further course of action will be decided!

"
1698,5.0 ,"  Great dual speakers (louder and better than the ones from iPhone 8+, great camera and even greater screen. The new fast charging is a little faster than the usual oneplus fast charging.Overall a great phone, I guess the best oneplus device since the OP3 release

"
1702,4.0 ,"  Awesome device with awesome features. 1 star less just for camera bump due to that it is very difficult to find good case that supports Oneplus official 3D glass protector. I spent 1300 on OnePlus official tempered glass now there is no budget friendly covers that supports it.

1708,5.0 ,"  It's a shut up and take my money phone. I have been calling in love with this phone since the time I first had my hands over it. Being my first oneplus device. I must say it's awesome from every point of view.

"
1709,4.0 ,"  Overall One Plus is really good but Amazon lacks in packing the product properly. It's not only for this product but everytime. There is no proper protection for the product. And this time the packing was tempered.

"
1716,5.0 ,"  This phone is silky smooth and silly fast with that 90Hz refresh rate. The camera quality is quite impressive too. The only concern is the battery life which doesn't feel much of an issue with the Warp Charge 30T.

"
1717,4.0 ,"  Once a one plus, always a one plus. Reminded of it after buying op7t after losing op6 7 months back. Camera has improved a lot. Os is one of the greaest things. But phone getting hanged once in a while, never happened before with op. Is it due to 90 hz being used continuously? Anyone else facing the same issue?

"

1727,4.0 ,"  In terms of performance, display, quick charge, sound clarity and much more that they provide it's amazing. The only thing that i noticed that oneplus has great hardware capabilities but i think they provide same as software side otherwise this is the best that i have.

Returned the device on 15 and had to wait a lot for it to reach the manufacturer in Haryana and get refund. They probably are fast in delivering the products but not in returns and refunds

"
1739,5.0 ,"  The In-display fingerprint sensor is lightning fast. The photo quality is awesome, especially loved taking the macroshots & I don't Wanna talk about the battery performance when there is a wrap charge 30T the technology is included.

"

"
1887,5.0 ,"  This is a great phone, good value. The triple camera is the correct set of cameras, and once the OnePlus8 released where it replaced the telephoto, this was a no-brainer. I actually like the waterdrop more than the hole-punch, but that is a very minor preference.

"
1888,4.0 ,"  Not so good not so bad Not so good not so bad ... Price is higher.. it's okay but camera quality is good .. not compare to Google pixel 2xl .. Google pixel 2xl is single camera .. and OnePlus have 3 .. but Google is win .. so that's why I am telling not so good not so bad ..

"
1911,4.0 ,"  The battery life is bad even after optimization to the least battery drainage. 90Hz refresh is really smooth and the difference can be felt but drains charge on the already sad battery. My phone doesn't even last a day on a decent above average use. Otherwise a good phone.

"
1912,1.0 ,"  The scratch guard is not placed properly and is coming out of the screen. Amazon arranged for a technician to have an inspection of the phone. The technician used his 2 inch long nail to peal out the scratch guard and then says it is temporary guard , you should remove it.

"
1913,5.0 ,"  Silly fast. Can never go back to 60Hz again like u can never go back form AMOLED to LCD. Pretty big phone. Battery is average, can last for 1 day max. Oxygen OS is too simple to go back to any of those heavy launchers on other phones.

"
1937,5.0 ,"  The Phone is absolutely a charm to use, low light photos are crisp , battery draining might be a issue bit 1+ played the cards of 30w charging which covers it up. On a whole it's the best phone you can have at this price point for users looking for a all rounder phone.

"
1943,5.0 ,"  One of the finest devices that i have ever used. The devices keep getting finer and better. The camera experience is pretty insane. One of the best camers from oneplus. Kudos. You just go for it when you see the oneplus branding on it.

"
1951,5.0 ,"  5 stars for camera, performance and its 90fps display which runs heavy games like pubg better than any other phone. As a gamer, I expect little more battery life and 3.5mm headphone jack. Otherwise I'm fully satisfied with the phone.

"
2334,5.0 ,"  The nightscape mode could have been better else it's a great value phone. The 90 hz display will literally spoil you. About the battery life, it isn't the best but it isn't a deal breaker since the warp charge 30T is already included in the box and it sure charges quickly.

"
2358,5.0 ,"  Product is good,only issue with the battery it's draining very fast. Premium phone like One plus 7 t must have a solution for this. Because we are spending almost 38k and your battery not lasting means it's a wastage of money.

2376,5.0 ,"  Worth buying.

"
